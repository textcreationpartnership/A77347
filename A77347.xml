            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Never expected, that my Book against the <hi>Maſs</hi> ſhould have the liberty to go abroad two Years together, without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſition: nor that two Points ſo dear and ſo fundamental to <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Maſs Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> are, could be left ſo long in the Dirt, and under the Impeachment of that Lewdneſs and Impiety, that I have accuſed, and I hope convicted them of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Advocate to defend them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am not at all ſurpriz'd, that after ſo long a time, an Anſwer is pretended to be made to it: But ſuch an Anſwer, ſo emty and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, I muſt confeſs I did not expect, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſe, as bad as it was, tho it could not find good Reaſon, would yet have had good Sophiſtry, and Artificial Colour to defend it. But ſince that <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> are pleaſed to take up with theſe moſt trivial Shifts and Cavils, and in ſpight of both Senſe and Grace perſiſt in an Abuſe, which neither they nor
<pb facs="tcp:132423:3"/>any body elſe can in any tolerable manner ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie: the next thing which I have to do, is to examine what the ſpecial Attractives are, which can draw Men to, and detain them in ſuch a ſtrange and unchriſtian kind of Worſhip. Here I do not propoſe to my ſelf the cure of ſuch as are already prepoſſeſſed, and throughly ſick with wilful Ignorance. He that can cure the Deaf, and the Dumb, is alone the immediate and proper Phyſitian for that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But I do what I ought, when I do what <hi>I</hi> can, to hinder the Plague from ſpreading, and them which are deſperatly ill with it from infecting others. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church abounds with prudent and politic Men, who can infuſe their <hi>Myſteries</hi> in as plauſible and Christian Words, as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Envoy did his Deſigns, in good and true Jewiſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Iſa. 36.</hi> The very <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> (a more reformed kind of Papiſts, whom therefore one might leſs ſuſpect) exceed ſometimes the <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in this black Art of diſguiſing: and <hi>I</hi> have had in Conferences,
<pb facs="tcp:132423:3"/>ſuch Experience of ſome of the beſt of this ſort, both at the <hi>French</hi> Court, and the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> that tho <hi>I</hi> may here ſpare their Names, <hi>I</hi> may not, with any Charity, ſpare to warn others, to take heed of their Companies. The proper Genius, and as it were, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit of that Church, conſiſts much in a <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to raiſe any thing which they have, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho that were but a Dung-hill, into a Caſtle; and by the noiſe of ſtrange Expreſſions, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you out of your own knowledge, that you may believe the <hi>Enchantment. Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Maſs Sacrifice, Purgatory,</hi> and their pretended <hi>Infallibility,</hi> had bin as ſoon tumbled down, as ſtarted up, had they not bin kept on foot by this kind of Roman <hi>Hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm;</hi> and the better to turn both Mens Brains and Hearts to that ſide, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Catholicneſs, Miracles, Suffrages, Confraternities, Church Treſury, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, &amp;c.</hi> (the very Dirt and Dung of that Church) are by the ſame Art and Valor erected into plauſible <hi>Means</hi> of Worſhip and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:132423:4"/>Therefore my preſent buſineſs is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe, and other-like Snares out of the way: and to let impartial Men ſee, that the very <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> wherewith they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur'd and baited to Popery, are the very <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Imoſtume,</hi> that ſhould deter them from it. To this end, <hi>I</hi> fetch out the Soot and Aſhes which lie hidden in the skin of a <hi>Sodom,</hi> when it paſſes for a <hi>Golden Apple:</hi> and, as the Fathers did before me, under the firſt Chriſtian Emperors, <hi>I</hi> expoſe to public view the <hi>Vermine,</hi> the <hi>Cats,</hi> the <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> and other ſuch fooliſh <hi>Idols,</hi> which are adored by vulgar People, upon the credit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of pompous and ſtately <hi>Temples.</hi> In this unbowelling of <hi>Rome,</hi> I fear not what Papiſts ſhall ſay, and ſome unexperienced Chriſtians perhaps ſuſpect, as if <hi>I</hi> made the caſe worſe; for <hi>I</hi> make it ſuch as <hi>I</hi> have ſeen it, and, not to be mine own witneſs, ſuch as <hi>I</hi> find it in their Authors. <hi>I</hi> might have bin as charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and as ignorant in theſe Affairs, as thoſe who know little of Popery, but what they read
<pb facs="tcp:132423:4"/>in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or what they heard of ſubtile <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> diſcourſing among raw Strangers: had I not bin made wiſer then ſo, both by the Times of Rebellion, that kept me <hi>17</hi> Years abroad among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves; and by the ſpecial favor of great Perſons, who during nine whole Years of that long Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, procured me the advantage of being pretty well acquainted with all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their <hi>Roman</hi> Learned Clergy. And to ſay this alſo by the way, the undeſerved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of ſome of them, and my Friends too, who were pleaſed to look upon me as a fit Man to be imploy'd about the great deſign then in hand, of Reconciling the two Religions, gave me ſuch an Acceſs into every corner of that Church, that it is much my Fault, if I do not know as well all that which is within its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, as thoſe Men do, who make it their great Buſineſs to Diſguiſe and Paint its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. As to the <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Savingneſs</hi> which it promiſeth (the great Imposture of the times) I do ſincerely repreſent here, both what
<pb facs="tcp:132423:5"/>it is, and what it can do. The truth is, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Sinners</hi> run generally for ſhelter to <hi>Rome,</hi> as broken <hi>Merchants</hi> do to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> with hope of being there ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ordinary courſe of Juſtice. So that as long as God, and the Kings Laws keep Men in awe, and that there ſhall be <hi>ranting</hi> and <hi>ſpending,</hi> neither that <hi>Priſon</hi> nor that <hi>Church</hi> can want good ſtore of <hi>Proſelytes.</hi> In order to make them throng in, when the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath the good luck to meet with tender Conſciences, ſhe will be ambitious to exceed all the degrees of Christian Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if ſhe meet with Men of a contrary temper, ſhe will accommodate them alſo with all the Condeſcentions of the looſeſt <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi> So let theſe Fiſhers caſt out their Nets at which ſide of the Ship they pleaſe, both the Superstitious &amp; the Profane, if they have the Grace but to fear Hell, ſhall be ſure to become their Prey. And upon this one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is a very great Wonder to me, and, as I hope, a great Mercy of God upon a better
<pb facs="tcp:132423:5"/>Posterity, that in this both moſt ignorant and ſinful Age, all, as well as many, do not run away from us to that promiſing Sanctuary. And this is the motive wherefore, in oppoſition to a more general Apoſtacy, I do here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to break the main ſtrength and courſe of the preſent Temtation; to diſcover and break the moſt dangerous Snares; and, with the help of God, to ſecure from the hazard of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, all ſuch Perſons as are not willing to periſh. If in all theſe Eſſaies, my Diſcourſes ſeem to be long, as I confeſs they are; this length, I hope, ſhall be tedious and uſeleſs to none but to ſuch as read them only, that they may divertiſe themſelves, which end this Book is not made for; my real intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this, to give Men a ſolid account both of the true Chriſtian Doctrine; that is, of the true waies of God to ſave; and of the new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Wiles of other Spirits, to ſeduce Souls. Of theſe I have ſaid as much as at this time I could prove out of their Books; but much leſs, then I know, by mine own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb facs="tcp:132423:6"/>It is a groſs mistake, to think that the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> is made up of nothing elſe, then what we find in their Councils and Breviaries. You might fanſie as well, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath all within the Walls of the City, and little or nothing in the Suburbs; and that all her unwritten Traditions are deſtitute of unwritten Waies and Practices. The truth is, in time of War the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> love to Camp as cloſe as they can to <hi>Lateran,</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> and to ſuch other Council <hi>Forts,</hi> while they ſtand upon their defence; but they dwell and ſpread infinitly farther about, when in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Times they have a mind either to win, or conquer others: and I may ſafely affirm, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath no ground more commodious for Ambuſhes, nor more dangerous to poor Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then what ſhe can either take or leave, as ſhe ſees cauſe. There is not ſo deadly biting, as with thoſe Teeth, that Vipers, as they ſay, can keep unſeen in their Gums; nor are there fitter Tools to do miſchief, then thoſe ſhort Weapons, which one draws out, or hides under
<pb facs="tcp:132423:6"/>his Clothes. The <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that can offer you Salvation on any terms; if you take them, they are that which in their Language muſt needs eaſe you of all your Sins; and if you happen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Cheat, and the incredible Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, then ſhe hath other graver Doctors that will tell you (in order to ſave her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) that theſe are but the Dreams of ſome Monks, and no part of their Catholic Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. So let that Church mix and temper whatever kind of stuff ſhe pleaſes, to charm you into her Party; if ſhe find you well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to devour it, then ſhe gives it you as good Meat; but if ſhe ſee that you abhor it, then to pleaſe you, ſhe will diſown it as rank Poiſon. By theſe means, <hi>Rome</hi> both abuſeth the World, and keeps up her Reputation; and under this Colluſion, lies, works, and thrives, the Myſtery of Iniquity, and the Power of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>If after this ſecond Warning, Men will fall off to a Religion, which in its moſt Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb facs="tcp:132423:7"/>Services (as I have already ſhewed) is plain impiety, and be led to it by Motives which I ſhew here to be no other then the worſt kind of Impoſtures, their Blood ſhall fall on their own Heads. It is not in the power of human Help in this caſe to ſave Men, who will deſtroy themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>A General Account of the new Waies to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Services of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WELL may the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> look Full and Rich, ſince what the Church of Chriſt hath ſingle, ſhe ſtill hath double, and of different ſorts; keeping in her Boſom as much of good and bad together, as can both furniſh true Catholics with the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith, and lend to others, thereon to build whole heaps of ruinous Superſtitions and Abuſes. Here you ſhall find under one Roof, the Eternal God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a Mortal Woman, ſtanding very near upon the ſame ground, both for your Worſhip and Praiers: Two ſorts of Chriſts called upon in the ſame way; the one born of a Virgin, and the other made by a Maſs Prieſt: two neceſſary Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:132423:9"/>for the Salvation of Mankind; one once offered up to God on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and another which is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up every day upon an <hi>Altar:</hi> Two ſorts of <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>Advocates,</hi> worſhipped and ſurrounded with an equal number of Clients; our Bleſſed Savior, and Canoniz'd Saints. Suitably to theſe two different ſorts of Patrons, you ſhall find in the ſame Church two different waies of obtaining pardon of ſins; the one by the Evangelical Mercy of God upon all men, whoſoever ſhall repent, and believe on his Son; and another by the Bulls of the Pope, for them who will either pray before an Image, or without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Praiers, look devoutly towards an Altar: Two Ladders to get up to Heaven, one white with the milk of <hi>Mary,</hi> the other red with the Blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> both equally puzling poor Worſhippers about the choice: Two ſorts of ſufferings to be allow'd to ſinners for their behoof and benefit, the Paſſion of the ſame Savior, and the Mortifications and Services of the Saints: Finally, two ſorts of Spiritual Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and Ghoſtly Fraternity; that of Chriſt, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in Faith and Holineſs, and that of the <hi>Roſary</hi> for inſtance, or S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and twenty more, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beads, or wearing Frocks or Girdles, and by ſuch other new Performances. To join and keep all this together, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſubmits to two Heads; the Son of God in Heaven, and his Holineſs in <hi>Italy;</hi> and Preaches two different, and ſometimes contrary words of God, which you muſt embrace both together with the ſame Devotion and Faith, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the written word of God, which you may find in the Holy Scripture, and the unwritten Tradition, which you muſt ſeek in that Churches Breaſt.</p>
               <p>In this unhappy conjuncture of true Catholic Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132423:9"/>and of mere <hi>Roman</hi> Popery, that happens which you may obſerve, either in unnatural and beaſtly Copulations, the baſer kind ſpoils the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or in the Dreams of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the ugly deſtroies the well-favor'd. We find by ſad experiences in theſe laſt times of the Goſpel, what heretofore was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Ceremonies, and alſo expreſſed ever after, by unhappy Examples under the Law; the Fleſh which was conſecrated and made holy at Gods Altar, had not the ſame vertue to ſanctifie the unclean, as the unclean had to defile that which was Holy. Nor were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo powerful to convert the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Jebuſites</hi> to God (when Married together) as were the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> to ſeduce them to their Idols: and for this conſideration the Law forbad ſuch Societies. Corrupt Nature, we know, hath of it ſelf both a ſtrange tendency to frivolous and unlawful, and no leſs averſneſs from truly good and holy things: ſo, tho the power of both were equal, as to ſanctifying, or corrupting, our inward Inclinations are more likely to determine us to the worſt ſide. Never were Women ſo ready to part with their choiceſt Jewels, as when 'twas to make a Golden Calf: nor could ever ſo many Fathers have bin perſwaded to be ſo cruel, as to paſs their Children thro the fire, had it not bin to ſerve <hi>Molock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is by our Savior compar'd to Seed; now one handful of Tare is enough to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and over-run a whole Field. Hence it is, that tho the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> retained the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as the Papiſts do at this preſent the Goſpel; yet the holy Prophets mention no other Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Dan,</hi> or <hi>Beer ſheba,</hi> but the waies of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Ordinances of <hi>Omry.</hi> And tho the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:132423:10"/>did make profeſſion to ſerve the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> among the gods of other Nations, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33. Yet their ſervice to theſe ſo immediatly takes up their whole Devotion, that in the following Verſe you find, that they do not fear God at all.</p>
               <p>It is by this fatal prevalency of evil over good, and the corrupt readineſs of Men to yield to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, that the <hi>Roman</hi> ſuperſtition hath not only over-topped, but even over-whelmed the Catholic Faith, to that degree, as any Chriſtian may both ſee it, if he have Eies, and muſt deplore it too, if he have any ſenſe or fear of God. What the Bleſſed Evangeliſts have ſet down in the four Goſpels, and what the Bleſſed Apoſtles have Preached upon it thro the whole World, is yet at <hi>Rome</hi> as to its being; but as to its condition, there it is as miſerably buried under the confuſed heap of other new &amp; unchriſtian ſervices, as ever was that Book of the Law, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. under the Ruines of the Temple. Their Maſſes, Legends, Auricular Confeſſions, Bulls, Praiers to Saints, and the Worſhipping of Images fill up the Churches, and make the main Bulk of all viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. There if ſome good Praiers to God Almighty appear by chance among the Croud, it is as one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster</hi> among many <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, that is, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten in their Beads; and if you take the pains to compare how many <hi>Praiers, Proſes, Panegyrics,</hi> and other expreſſions of the deepeſt Devotion, are beſtowed on the Virgin, with what is left for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior; there you ſhall find ſomewhat the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them two, as you may ſee both in the Images that repreſent them in their Churches, and in the moſt Authentic Viſions, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew them together to their <hi>Monks,</hi> where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132423:10"/>ſhe appears ſtill with all the Pomp that can attend a glorious Queen, whil'ſt Chriſt her Son is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented but as a Child. Thus Papiſts have the Common Faith (and I wiſh to God they had no more) and their own proper Romaniſm, to the very ſame or like purpoſe, as the Jews have the Law and the Prophets, and the <hi>Talmud</hi> of their Rabbies; and as the <hi>Turks</hi> have both much of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Impieties of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> this latter to choak the former, as the Tares in the Parable did the good Seed; or to diſhonor and abuſe it, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. did the holy Veſſels of Gods houſe.</p>
               <p>To make all theſe ſins more ſinful, and Popery more dangerous; theſe unhappy Superſtructures, which lie as a heavy Encumbrance upon the holy Foundation of God, are now adaies uſed as ſo many Snares and Attractives to draw Men to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Proteſtants have among themſelves neither better, nor other waies of ſaving diſtreſſed Sinners, then by charging them to forſake ſin, to believe and to live according to the Goſpel, and with this Faith, &amp; the uſe of Divine Ordinances, to caſt their burden and themſelves on the Mercies of God in Chriſt; whereas over and above all this, the Papiſts have a great deal more, which others do lay no claim to. Firſt, they have the <hi>Queen of Heaven</hi> and the Mother of Compaſſions, who is unknown on this account to the beſt Churches. And this Goddeſs is repreſented, as ſuch a Treſurer of all Graces, and a Favorer of ſuch Perſons, and upon ſuch good and eaſie terms, as without her it were abſolutely vain to expect ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the aid even of the whole Trinity. In the ſecond place, they have millions of Saints,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132423:11"/>who whenſoever called upon, make it their buſineſs to help, as much as in them lies, every condition, ſort, and profeſſion of Men. There is never a ſmall Pariſh, nor Trade, no nor any exigence, want, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but hath ſome favorable and proper Saint. The very Images of Wood and Stone are inſtrumental to great Bleſſings: their Churches and Altars are conſecrated in ſuch a manner, that the very coming near them, forgives ſome ſins. The ſound and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells, if Chriſtned after their way, hath much vertue. Who knows not how much devout perſons are benefited by Holy Water, and devout Praiers improved to high Merits by holy Beads? It were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite to ſay all that is pretended of the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> Medals, and a numberleſs ſtore of Relics, and how they are working every day up and down the World for believing Catholics, more Cures then you can ever imagine. The Milk, the Hairs, the Shift, the Shoes, but eſpecially the Girdle of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are to this purpoſe tried and well known. What ſhall we ſay of thoſe ſwelling Streams, which, tho they do not ſanctifie Sinners, yet overflow them with Pardons? I mean the Bulls and Indulgences, the Confraternities, the Maſſes upon priviledged Altars, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iers before certain Images, Stations and Jubilees upon viſiting of certain Churches, great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Powers conferred on certain Prieſts, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever occaſion requires it, for diſpenſing with ugly things at eaſie rates: poor Proteſtants, I ſay, want altogether all theſe Bleſſings, and bleſſed Catholics abound with them. And if any of theſe waies of attaining Salvation ſeem to ſome Men inconceivable; this very inconceivableneſs is thought by others a proper Character to ſet out all for Myſteries. And if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132423:11"/>that do not fully ſatisfie all Mens Conſciences, this muſt, namely that their <hi>Roman</hi> is the undoubted Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholic Church, and that the Catholic Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err.</p>
               <p>Such things as theſe have a great weight with Ignorant, and ſometimes too with intelligent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who find themſelves both loaden with their ſins, and unwilling to part with them. And who could blame poor Creatures for going to <hi>Rome</hi> for ſuch Pardons, as it is certain they can never find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, nor in the Goſpel, nor in Heaven, nor any where elſe but at <hi>Rome?</hi> Therefore I think it chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to undeceive men in theſe matters; and convince unhappy <hi>Saul,</hi> if his obdurate Heart be not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable of reaſonable Inſtruction, that what he ſees or hears at <hi>Endor,</hi> tho perhaps ſounding like the Voice, and looking like the Appearance of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> in the night time, will be found in the day light, not to be any thing but the Enchantment or Cheat of a poor and ſilly Witch. I will begin with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, becauſe it is the firſt Varniſh that they adorn their Errors with, and the general Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby they inveigle both themſelves and others.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Papiſts are much pleaſed with calling themſelves Catholics, and take it
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de Eccleſ. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> for the firſt Mark and Acknowledgment of their Church, when ſometimes others call them ſo; not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean while, that Titles in all kinds of Tongues do continue moſt commonly long after the things ſignified by them are gon: and that we may call <hi>Rome</hi> the Catholic, upon the ſame account that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 4.5. calls ſtill <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Holy City, tho this hath loſt her Holineſs, as that hath depraved her Religion.</p>
               <p>Catholic Doctrine and Service, rightly applied, and called ſo, is the moſt eſſential Jewel, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul of true Churches. The firſt Title they ever had, after Chriſt was gon up to Heaven, was to be called Chriſtian: the ſecond was, after the bleſſed Apoſtles had planted them in moſt Countries, to be called Apoſtolical: the third, if Churches did keep faithfully that Goſpel, which had bin Preached by the Apoſtles every where, both ſuch Churches and ſuch Doctrines were entitled Catholic. This laſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is the eſſential Seal and Character of the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for whatſoever is thus Catholic, that is thus
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132423:12"/>grown Univerſal thro-out all Churches, and in all times, ſince the preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, let it be where it will, at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is both Apoſtolical and Chriſtian: and therefore <hi>S. Paul Coloſſ.</hi> 1.6. and 23. uſes it twice, as an infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to demonſtrate, that the Doctrine which the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had heard either from him, or from <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi> was the true Goſpel of Chriſt, becauſe it was come to them and all the world, and <hi>was preached to every Creature under Heaven.</hi> Men may ſet up ſmall Candles, that can fill with light private Rooms, and if carried about, lead Travellers ſome part of their way: but none but God alone can make ſuch a Light as the Sun is, that can in a moment, as the Sun doth, ſpread a bright day over the whole world. No Philoſophers that we know, were ever able with all their wit, to extend their Opinions beyond their Scholes; nor the greateſt Kings with their might, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Laws beyond their Dominions; nor the worſt Heretics ſpread their Errors much farther then their ſeveral Abodes. The true Doctrine of Chriſt only, and all ſuch other holy Precepts, Ordinances, and Traditions, as are proper to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; as they went forth with a divine commiſſion, had ſutable Power to carry them, and to maintain them thro-out all parts, and to all Creatures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where <hi>(whom God would call)</hi> in the whole world. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.9. Hence come ſuch Doctrines, and the Churches on their account to be called Catholic. As for all other private Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Cuſtomes, and Traditions whatſoever, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intended by their Authors to follow cloſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, they could never reach half the way: they ſtaied behind; they wanted breath; they had not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132423:13"/>the Arm of the Lord, nor the power of his Spirit, which the Goſpel had, to carry and convey them ſo far. Thus without any exception, whatſoever you can find has bin made thus general among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from its very beginning, (and nothing elſe) is Chriſtian, and Apoſtolical, and truly Catholic, by this infallible token, and upon this account, becauſe it had the ſtrength and Almighty Spirit of God to make it ſo, and without which it could not be ſo.</p>
               <p>Thus one may judg of the Catholicneſs, which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> brag of, and challenge on two accounts, the firſt, when they give it to their Church, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the honor of being the Catholic Church; the ſecond, when they give it to their new Doctrines, and Traditions, and obtrude all as Catholic. By the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church in the firſt ſenſe, nothing elſe can be underſtood, but an Univerſal Collection of all the Churches in the world, and of all Chriſtians in thoſe Churches, which by the ſame faith join together into one Communion of Chriſt their Savior and their Head; as all the Boughs of a Tree, however ſpread and ſcattered one from the other, unite into one ſtem; as all Rivers into one Sea; and as the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into one Kingdom. After this rate, if the Pope be the Univerſal or Catholic Biſhop, you muſt needs conclude thence againſt him, as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great did ſeveral
<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Gregor. Magn. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Indict.</hi> 13. <hi>Ep.</hi> 32. <hi>item Ep.</hi> 36. <hi>item l.</hi> 7. <hi>Ind.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 30.</note> times againſt the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> Patriarch: if one, ſaith he, be called the Univerſal Biſhop, this one hath all, and all the other Biſhops have nothing left: and thus if <hi>Rome</hi> be the Catholic Church, the other Churches are no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132423:13"/>Churches: <hi>Rome</hi> alone is the whole World, and this Tiber the whole Ocean.</p>
               <p>To this ſome are pleaſed to ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is the Catholic Church, not collectively or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, that is not by being in her ſelf the collective and extended body of all the Churches, but virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and as the eminent Cardinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, eminently, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> hath an eminent Power Influence and Empire over other Churches. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> is all Chriſtendom; as if one ſhould ſay <hi>London</hi> is all <hi>England,</hi> when the King and the Parliament ſit at <hi>Weſtminster;</hi> &amp; the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the High Prieſt and his Sanhedrin keep their Courts there: Which is to ſay, not that all Chriſtendom is contained in the precinct and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of <hi>Rome,</hi> but under its hand and power. Thus to be the Catholic, is not to be the Univerſal, but only the Domineering Church, and ſo far <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic; which many wiſe men take for a Bull: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it ſounds better then they are aware of, ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> love to be Maſters, and ſince the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Power hath bin a great while under their hand. But there is a reply againſt all this, that no Roman Power or wit can well ſhift off, Firſt, this notion of Catholic, to ſignifie commanding or Monarchical, is altogether unuſual, and unheard of among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; eſpecially St <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who are all for keeping cloſe to the Catholic Church and Faith; and all, at the ſame time, for keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Churches free from the Monarchy of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, it is, tho it were true, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſuch purpoſes as the Papiſts apply it to. For ſuppoſe <hi>Rome</hi> hath the Power; hath ſhe therefore the Holineſs, the Infallibity, the Promiſes of being led
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132423:14"/>into all truth by the Spirit? Hath ſhe all ſuch other great advantages which are made to the Catholic U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, and not to the Catholic Reigning Church? Did <hi>Aaron</hi> never make an Idol, altho he was the Lords high Prieſt? Were either the Scribes ever kept from inventing idle Traditions, by being Rulers in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> or St <hi>Peter,</hi> from curſing himſelf, and denying his own Maſter, by that Juriſdiction, they ſay, he had over the reſt of the Apoſtles? Is his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for inſtance, <hi>John</hi> the twelfth, or <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the one leſs effeminate, the other leſs a ſorcerer, or either of them more holy, for all the power they ſay they have both over all the Kings of the Earth, and over all the Churches of Chriſt? And may not the holy City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be turned both into a Den of Thieves, or into a Synagogue of Devils, altho you believe her to have a very great and eminent ſway over all the Tribes of Iſrael? Therefore it is not the Catholic, that is, the Monarchical, but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in a better ſenſe, that is, the Univerſal Church of Chriſt, that hath the Promiſes of God, and this excellent Privilege, which both Papiſts and others look for, of bringing all its truly Catholic Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>But admit all what they would have, that their Church may be ſaid to be the Catholic, becauſe it has dominion over all other Churches: whence comes this Catholic Power, that can make her as really to be, as to be ſaid ſo? It comes, they ſay, by lawful ſucceſſion from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who had it, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd it to their Popes. This is, I confeſs, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, but hardly maintained or underſtood. For firſt, St <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of it, when he reſiſted this Soveraign both publicly and to his Face, <hi>Galat.</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:132423:14"/>2.11. Nor did the whole College of Apoſtles, when they ſent him with <hi>John</hi> as freely, as now the Pope ſends his Legats, to ſettle the Church at <hi>Ceſarea, Acts</hi> 8.14. Nor the whole Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when they called him to an account about his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior with the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.2.3.

               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe, againſt all what I have ſaid,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132423:15"/>that St <hi>Peter</hi> had, during his life, an Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; What ſound Reaſon, what clear Text of the holy Scripture, or what undoubted Tradition, can any one allege to ſhew he left it to a Succeſſor? Did he leave him alſo his other Gifts and Privileges, and among them his Faith of Miracles, his Apoſtolical Rod to ſtrike men with, ſome to the ground, as they ſay he did at <hi>Rome Simon Magus;</hi> and others to their very Graves, as he did certainly <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira?</hi> Did he paſs to his Succeſſor his ſpecial Commiſſion and Apoſtleſhip over the Jews? Did St <hi>Paul</hi> leave either at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in any other Cities he was in, proper Apoſtles to ſucceed him in all his Prerogatives among the Gentiles? Let any one ſhew me, where the twelve are whom <hi>James, John,</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and all the reſt of the Apoſtles, left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with equal Power in their rooms; and then let, if you pleaſe, the Popes, in quality of <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, reign over them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe there were any where in the World ſuch an Apoſtolical Sacred College; What claim hath <hi>Rome,</hi> more then another place, to the Headſhip of this College? Is it not as likely, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> would have left his Throne at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he made the firſt Chriſtians, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> where no Scripture ſaies he was ever to make any? Would not one think that his firſt Chair, namely that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> which alwaies hath bin honored with a kind of Holy-day thro Chriſtendom, ſhould aſſoon be the Seat of their Univerſal Empire, as his other ſecond Chair at <hi>Rome;</hi> which if it have now the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, hath it but

So theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Worthies, the Murderer of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Murderer of his own King, have firſt founded that Univerſal Eminence, which hath made <hi>Rome</hi> thus Catholic.</p>
               <p>The Foundation being thus laid down, both for Primacy over other Churches, and for Reverence and Dignity among moſt Chriſtian Potentates, who ever ſhewed themſelves exceeding liberal on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts (for as yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy went but thus far;) the next task was to raiſe it up from this degree to in abſolute Monarchy. Both the Invaſions of Turks, and the Broils and Diſſentions that happened among the Chriſtian Princes, helped the Popes to ſhake off all Subjection: and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and practiced ſo well the Art of Building upon Ruins, that he left to his Succeſſors, partly in Deſign, partly in actual Uſurpation, very fair ground to advance farther by theſe Rules, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Popes Dictates.

               <p>The Project of this vaſt Empire comes fully either to the Infernal Pride, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132423:17"/>Bedlam Diſtemper, who, whatſoever they hear or ſee, imagine it to be their own. But take the whole work as you pleaſe, either as mad, or as impious, it becomes well its three Builders: The firſt is <hi>Phocas,</hi> a Villain, who
<note n="ſ" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Theophan. Miſcell. l.</hi> 17.</note> Murthered both his own Maſter and Emperor, &amp; his Maſters Roial Family, his Wife, his ſix Sons and two Daughters. His Holineſs, I ſay, ows his firſt Title of Univerſal Biſhop to this abominable Maſſacre. The ſecond is <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, before called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who is branded among many for a Magician of the worſt fort, and for a peſtilent Incendiary, both in arming Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Princes, and (which is more unnatural) the very Children againſt their Fathers: And at laſt, being at the point of death, he himſelf confeſſed in the preſence

Thus it appears, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholic Church in no ſenſe, neither formally or properly, as it ſignifies the whole Univerſal Church of Chriſt; nor virtually or eminently, in their unproper and unuſual notion, by having any lawful univerſal Dominion and Headſhip over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches.</p>
               <note n="t" place="bottom">Benno Cardinalis. de Gest. Hildebr.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:132423:17"/>
               <p>Now I come to the ſecond part of the matter in queſtion, to demonſtrate, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no truly Catholic Church at all (much leſs the Catholic Church) further then it agrees with ours: and that the proper notion of Catholic, excludes as inconſiſtent with the Apoſtolical and Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whatſoever ſhe pretends as proper to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I begin with the Doctrine concerning St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion. Ask them that know, what is properly Catholic, they will tell you after honeſt <hi>Lirinenſis,</hi>

                     <hi>Vincent. Lirin. c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>'Tis that which is believed by all Christians in all ages,</hi> and every where. I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated already, that St <hi>Peters</hi> Roial Power was not believed by the Apoſtles, nor in any Apoſtolical times; and made it good out of Acts and Evidences altogether incompatible with, &amp; deſtructive of this Belief: namely, His being rebuked by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both to the Face and publicly; his being called to account by his Brethren; his being ſent to <hi>Ceſarea, &amp;c.</hi> Can you think, that if at his return, they had found him guilty of ſuch a foul miſcarriage as would ſend whole Nations to Hell, they had thought it preſumtion, as the Canon Law ſaies it is, to ask wherefore he did ſo? Was it ever heard among the twelve, that beſides the general Commiſſion of Preaching Chriſt, St. <hi>Peter</hi> had another more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and proper Power of degrading all ſuch Princes, as would not be ruled by his Bulls? And if he had it not; Is it likely that the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Popes have more Secular Power from Chriſt then he, for compenſation of their having leſs Holineſs? To come lower to the holy Fathers; read their Epiſtles to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132423:18"/>then Popes, and judg whether St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil, &amp;c.</hi> did believe them to be their Monarchs, when they call them (as commonly they do) their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Fellow-ſervants. Did St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and his Brethren, the worthieſt Prelats of that Age, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves very modeſtly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Power, of controlling by their Legats and Officers the <hi>African</hi> Church Affairs, when they called it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again Secular

Or if the Papiſts ſay (for I know not what they can ſay elſe) that theſe places of Scripture, which they now mainly ſtand upon, are not ſo clear to their purpoſe, without the help of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132423:18"/>Tradition; Did St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and all the reſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> not yet know what Tradition was or what it ſaid?

To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, tell me I pray, Whether and where S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> or St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> did ſwear Canonical Obedience to his Holineſs when they were conſecrated? What ſums of Money did they ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> when they had thence got their <hi>Pallium?</hi> And when or where among a thouſand Prelats in the old Times, do you find one either ſubſcribing himſelf, or being called by others, as now they do, and are Arch-Biſhops or Biſhops of <hi>Milan,</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or any other Dioceſs, by the Grace of God, and <hi>of the Holy Apostolical See;</hi> fairly acknowledging themſelves thereby, little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then what they are now, meer Suffragans, Vicars, or Curats of that Univerſal Biſhop? I am ſure that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> abhorred, as long as he lived, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Title (and much more the Uſurpation) as

               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Roman</hi> Supremacy, go on, and look upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs; you know what great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that Sacrifice has among them.

I ſay then in the ſecond place, that this vaſt and comprehenſive Bulk is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then Catholic.

Go therefore and ſeek, when and where the twelve Apoſtles ever offered in Preaching their Savior to men, to offer him up, and to make him a Victime to God. Enquire of all the Holy Fathers, when and where they ſung any Maſs publicly without any Communicants except the Prieſts? When and where they ever ſolemnly and publicly adminiſtred the holy Communion under one kind? When and where they ever heard one ſingle ſyllable of thoſe Unchriſtian Doctrines, that now a daies make the Main Fundamentals of the Romiſh Religion? to wit, that Chriſt offered up himſelf to God as an Expiatory Sacrifice any where elſe but on the Croſs; that the Natural Body of Chriſt is both in Heaven upon a Throne, and on Earth on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Altars; that here his Body contracts &amp; ſhrinks it ſelf into the compaſs of a ſmall Crumb of Bread,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132423:19"/>or any the leaſt drop of Wine; that theſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crumbs and Drops, altho emtied to all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and attenuated to meer Accidents, can both well ſubſiſt by themſelves, and whitherſoever they be driven, pull along with them the Fleſh of Chriſt. If theſe and other like Doctrines, which now are eſſential to <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs, had in Ancient time bin Preach'd and heard as eſſential to Chriſtian Faith; Where was all the wit of <hi>Celſus,</hi> or the malice of <hi>Julian,</hi> and ſuch Enemies of Chriſt Jeſus, when they fell foul upon the Bleſſed Trinity, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and all ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles as ſeemed to them ridiculous, to ſpare both the Maſs-Sacrifice and the Tranſubſtantiation, that both are, and ſeem to be ſo?

Thus the Papiſts are not without Antiquity, ſuch as it is: for I may ſay in general, and prove too by many Inſtances, that <hi>Jews, Gentils,</hi> and old <hi>Heretics</hi> ſcarce ever had any famous and general Abuſe among them, but <hi>Rome</hi> woud have ſomewhat of it. But as for truly Chriſtian and Apoſtolical Antiquity, ſuch as can be the only Root, and eſſential Character of Catholic Doctrine; I may ſafely defie the beſt of them to name me any one Article proper to their own <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> that is ancient in this ſenſe. And as to thoſe Articles of Chriſtian Faith, which they have in common with us, and are truly Apoſtolical and Catholic; it is moſt pitiful to think, how ſhamefully they abuſe and poiſon them by the mixture of their own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Roman ones. Therefore if you take this mixt and confuſed Body together, that is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at the beſt ſide, as it holds yet the fundamental Ground of Chriſtianity, which we profeſs; thus far I grant it is a true Church: and if you take it at the worſt, as to its proper <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrines, wherein it differs no more from us, then from all true Catholic
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132423:23"/>and Apoſtolical Antiquity; thus far it is, if a Church at all, a moſt corrupt, and deſperately infected one. But if you come to huddle up theſe two heterogeneous and incompatible Parts together, in order to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute eſtimate and denomination of the whole (as at the great day of the Lord one ſhall not appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other) then it were moſt unreaſonable that the leſſer and weaker part ſhould give the Title; and that the Cities of <hi>Sodoma, Gomorrha, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim</hi> ſhould be called holy Cities becauſe they have one Lot among them. The Mountain that has many Grains of Gold lying under it, is rock or ſand never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs: &amp; the Ocean is ſtill ſalt water, tho ſome Rivers, and ſome Shipwracks mix with it other liquors. Thus Papiſts are ridiculouſly vain, who brag as they do of our acknowledging their Church, to have the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtian Religion. For theſe eſſentials are not ſaving but where they have the Prevalency: and they can but aggravate ſin and leave it more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, where they are baffled and oppreſt. Can any man think that <hi>Pilats</hi> Judgment Hall becomes a Church, for having Chriſt ſtanding there to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? or that <hi>Dagons</hi> Temple becomes Gods houſe for having the Ark there ſhut up? No wiſe man looks for any Harveſt from a few handfulls of Wheat choaked with all manner of weeds: nor takes it to be good Paſture, which he ſees to be overgrown with Thorns. No ſincere Iſraelite can ever think of being ſaved by the Religion of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it keeps ſtill <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; nor by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Religion, becauſe they ſerve God as well as <hi>Baal.</hi> Mixt and corrupt Religions are not to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much in what is trodden under mens feet, as by what is predominant, and ſet upon their high Altars.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132423:24"/>The great Building raiſed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Adrian,</hi> did not ceaſe to be <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, for being raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon holy Foundations; and the beſt Altars of the Lord can procure no Atonement tho they be kept in good repair, when they ſerve for burning Swines Fleſh. Thus what expect you from the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while what is in it is but a Pedeſtal to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds of falſe Superſtitions? or from the Preaching of Chriſt, and himſelf crucified, the chiefeſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Salvation of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; as long as it is made a Foundation for an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Maſs Service?</p>
               <p>In the mean while, if Papiſts will ſtill bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and think that all is ſafe at home, becauſe they are called Catholics abroad (and for my part, I can but wonder to find here <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſo weak) let them remember, that in the ancient times, Men, as erroneous as they are, were called <hi>Gnoſtics, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,</hi> and <hi>Angelics,</hi> that is, Sublime and Angelical Chriſtians: and thus the very <hi>Turks</hi> may bleſs themſelves, whenſoever we call them <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> that is, Men of true ſaving Faith.

                  <hi>Concerning the ſecond Inducement to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, The</hi> Roman <hi>Miracles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NExt to the pretended Catholic Church, <hi>Roman Miracles</hi> are the main Pride of Popery, and its ſtrange Wonders, ſuch as they be, of <hi>Lauretta, Montſerrat,</hi> and other places, give as much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the <hi>Roman,</hi> as <hi>Delphi, Delos, Dodona,</hi> and ſuch other Seats of Heatheniſh Gods, did to the Heatheniſh Religion. The truth is, Miracles will carry a great weight, both with the unlearned and Learned Men, when they are right; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it much concerns every one that hath no mind to be cheated, well to know the right from the wrong.</p>
               <p>All true Chriſtian Miracles are ſupernatural, or extraordinary Works wrought for a time, either by the immediate Hand of God, or by the Mediation of Men and Angels, when moved or ſtrengthned thereto by him, for the farther authorizing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming true Catholic and Chriſtian Truth, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among Infidels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, true Chriſtian Miracles; not only to oppoſe them to all Cheating and Fabulous, but alſo to diſtinguiſh them from other more common ſupernatural Effects, which God is pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſhew promiſcuouſly among all ſorts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the aſſerting of his Power, Juſtice, Mercy; or more generally, his Divine Being in the courſe of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132423:25"/>his Providence: There is not a Nation in the whole World, but may find, if they will ſearch, many ſuch admirable Paſſages in their Chronicles; nor ſcarce any private Man, but may obſerve ſomwhat of theſe, as he calls them, ſtrange Accidents in his own time. It is moſt certain, that God ſent his Angels, and with them his great Judgments and Powers among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Javan, Dan.</hi> 10. as well as among the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> and beſides, what either the Earth or the Heavens can do by their proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and what Man-kind can add unto it, by their own good or bad conduct, in the ordinary courſe of things, the miraculous Hand of God often times over-rules ſo viſibly, that no ſober man can doubt of his interpoſition and guidance. Of this kind are the ſtupendous and unexpected riſes and falls of great Eſtates: the ſlaughters of many thouſands, mention'd in divers Hiſtories, by an inconſiderable handful of men: the raiſing of Princes among Pagans to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pitch of Moral Vertue, and Heroical Courage: the terrible Prodigies, Blazing-ſtars, and Predictions before great Deſolations and Plagues; ſomtimes Curſes, ſomtimes Bleſſings faſtned as it were to ſome Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No judicious Man will fancy, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> for example, or <hi>Alexander</hi> either, would undertake, or could perform their vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns amidſt their Diſadvantages, without ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular influence and help from above: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will conſider, what <hi>Plato</hi> was, and what he makes
<note n="a" place="bottom">Plato in Apolog. Socrat.</note> 
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> ſay before his death, can hardly forbear thinking, but that this Heroical Pagan had commonly the Aſſiſtance of a good Angel. Theſe, and other ſuch great Examples taken notice of by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132423:26"/>all ſorts of Hiſtorians, confirm the truth of Gods ſpecial care; about the conſervation of Societies, and ſignifie nothing at all about their true or untrue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Churches or Temples. If they did, where is that pitiful Sect or Country, but might allege ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Miracles to juſtifie its own Pagan or Heretical Perſwaſion? The Emperors <hi>Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> might have authorized, by this means, the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles: for both are ſaid
<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Corn. Tacitus, Hist. l.</hi> 4.</note> to have reſtor'd ſight to blind men: the Veſtal in <hi>Valerius,</hi> with her holding of Water in a Sieve, or drawing a Ship with her Girdle, might as well have aſſerted her Heatheniſh Religion, as her Perſonal Innocency. There is nothing ſo abſurd with the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> nor ſo impious with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which ſome Miracle or other wrought among them, might not countenance in ſome meſure. And without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back towards old times, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> with that gift which it is ſaid they have, of healing an otherwiſe ſcarcely curable Diſeaſe, might come near to juſtifie at once (which is both abſurd and impoſſible) both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Popery: So far do theſe Providential, differ from Chriſtian Miracles, as to the confirming of any Chriſtian Truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, that theſe true Chriſtian Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are commonly but <hi>for a time, and for the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing,</hi> &amp;c. For the Gift of working Miracles is, as that of ſpeaking Languages, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.12. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Converſion of Unbelievers, and for aſſiſting the Goſpel, whereſoever it ſhould be firſt Preach'd. Therefore the firſt Evangeliſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt Planters of Churches, as well as the Holy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132423:26"/>Apoſtles, had as long this help of Miracles, as God had Nations in the World, to whom he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vele his Will: which, being a work of many Years, this ſupernatural Hand of God help'd it forward, both in confounding Pagan Idols, and ſtrengthning Men againſt Pagan Perſecutions, till God had ſent Chriſtian Princes, to whoſe care he then committed the work (both of countenancing the Church thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all their Dominions, and of maſtering her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) which till then he did by his own hand. After this, 'tis certain Miracles ceaſed apace, if not to be, yet to be common, being thenceforth not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as before: Thoſe that continued the longeſt, were about the healing of Sickneſſes, and about the caſting out of Devils: and the corners where they continued, were thoſe wilde Deſerts and remote Places (the refuge of the Primitive Chriſtians from the Face of their Enemies) where there was more need of ſuch continued Wonders, becauſe that more Infidels did lurk there. And by the way, it may be imagin'd, that God inclined thoſe laſt Workers of Miracles, whoſe auſtere Life and Devotion now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies ſeems to us ſo ſtrange, * to leave the more cultivated World and retreat to Deſerts, in order to convert barbarous men in their moſt barbarous Countries.</p>
               <p>All this being done, and all known Parts and Creeks of the World being either moſtly converted, or ſufficiently called to the Chriſtian Faith, the Holy Fathers tell us, that Miracles

                  <hi>Servants of Chriſt having confirm'd their Preaching by true ſigns, call'd Men away from their Infidelity, to the Faith: now this firſt calling being over, the Devil will ſet up himſelf, by the means of his own Miracles, in order to draw Men back again from Faith to Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to this, God was pleaſed to take the ſame courſe in the publiſhing of the Goſpel, as he had bin pleaſed to take in the publiſhing of the Law. In this firſt he aſſerted the Glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the redemtion out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his own Law under <hi>Moſes,</hi> by ſuch Miracles as no <hi>Egyptian</hi> at laſt could queſtion, and no falſe God could counterfeit. For altho moſt of them, as for example, the producing of Lice, the dividing an Arm of the Sea, the making Thunders and Earth-quakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeemed not much to exceed that compaſs, which created Cauſes might have reach'd to: yet God ſo viſibly confounded both the skill of all Magicians, and the power of all Devils, that his Almighty Power and ſtretched-out Arm, did not appear ſo much in the very working of theſe Wonders, as in reſtraining the contrary Powers both of the Air, and of Hell, from attemting to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the like performances. Laſtly, God having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidenced both the Power of his Laws, and the Truth of his Promiſes, he thenceforth both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his Hand from working his former continually appearing Miracles, and takes off that reſtraint that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:132423:27"/>alone kept the Devils from either doing or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting any like them. And then, the Evil Spirits being let looſe again to their former Liberty, God gives his People this fair warning, againſt all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Miracles whatſoever: <hi>If there ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a Prophet, and give thee a Sign or a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. In like manner thoſe Miracles which uſhered the Holy Goſpel, and ſpread it over all the World, were in all reſpects unqueſtionable. Firſt, they were mark'd out before-hand, by clear infallible Prophecies, both of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35.5, 6. <hi>The eyes of the blind, &amp;c.</hi> And of <hi>Joel</hi> 3.28. <hi>I will pour my Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to remove farther out of the way, both all ſuſpicion and poſſibility of Error in thoſe firſt times, all the Devils and all their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were tied generally from all falſe and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Miracles: <hi>I beheld,</hi> ſaies our Savior very much to this purpoſe, <hi>Satan falling as Lightning from Heaven.</hi> His Oracles were over the World all upon a ſudden
<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch. de Orac. defect.</note> ſuppreſſed, Magicians and Seducers, if they attemted any thing, were either ſtruck blind, as <hi>Elymas</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> or ſilenced, as ſo many Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacs were in the Goſpel; or confounded, and even beaten down, when they thought to exalt themſelves, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as we find both in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the <hi>Eccleſiastical Hiſtory.</hi> Then, after a long courſe of true and infallible Miracles, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all reſpects both to perſwade men through all the World, and to ſeal the Holineſs and Importance of the Goſpel to all Ages; Satan is permitted to uſe his ancient Power again, both for the trial of the Believers, and the puniſhment of the Rebels. Then all ſorts of Seductions, falſe Revelations, and falſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132423:28"/>Miracles, could not but return back again by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Conſequence, and with greater Violence then ever, becauſe after a longer reſtraint. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon come the often repeted and ſerious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful warnings of Chriſt: <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Thus both in the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the firſt times and ſorts of Miracles do carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies along with them, and as it were in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, ſuch expreſs Characters of Gods hand, as is moſt proper and moſt ſufficient to put the Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all doubt: Therefore Chriſt often doth make uſe of them, <hi>John</hi> 5.36. and 9.37. And ſo do the Holy Prophets moſt celebrate and inſiſt upon thoſe Principal and Primitive ones, that had bin wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and by the firſt Judges. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſecond ſort of Miracles are all branded with ſuch black Marks, and diſcredited in all reſpects with ſuch heavy Charges and Warnings, as muſt needs affright all Chriſtians from being miſ-led, but thoſe who are pleaſed, or given over to be ſeduced by them. <hi>Maricon</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, I ſay, <hi>True Chriſtian Miracles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the confirming of Chriſtian Truth.</hi> This is their chief and ultimate end, tho in order to it they may and do ſerve commonly for other more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate accounts. Thus, when Chriſt cured the Sick, and caſt out Devils, theſe Miracles were to be lookt on both as extraordinary effects of his Divine Power, and moſt ſignal Expreſſions of his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132423:28"/>Mercy to thoſe perſons whom he did cure. Yet the main thing Chriſt aimed at, was this, that both thoſe who were cured, and thoſe who ſaw that they were ſo, might be perſwaded by ſuch wonders, that the expected <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come, that it was He; and that whatſoever he ſaid and commanded, was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and obeied. So Miracles were both to Chriſt &amp; Chriſts Miniſters, what Credential letters, badges and robes are to all Public Officers: and alſo were to the Goſpel, which they preached, what Signs and Seals are to the Articles, Patents, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, which are brought by thoſe Officers; that is to ſay, ſuch Confirmations and Evidences, that if all thoſe, to whom they were expreſly ſent would not believe them upon their word, or upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Doctrine, (which many did without more ado) they might do it by ſeeing their works. Hence it is that both our Savior, and his Apoſtles ever preached the Goſpel in the firſt place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by the words taken from the Law or the Prophets; and in the ſecond place, if what they ſaid, required in the hearers any farther Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in that caſe they ſhewed Miracles. <hi>They went forth,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. <hi>and preached e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, the Lord working with them,</hi> (inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his ſpirit,) <hi>and confirming the word with the Signs that followed.</hi> Therefore the following Signs having ſuch a ſpecial dependence and proper aſpect on the Goſpel, which went before; if no Goſpel, nor any thing eſſential to it is preached or delivered ſome other way, theſe Miracles are juſt like Seals and Signs, that are merely put to a Blank; and, as to Chriſtian Doctrine can ſignifie nothing at all. And ſo theſe Signs, if true, are merely Providential. If they be put to any true and real Deed, but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132423:29"/>afterwards with Clauſes, that cannot well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with it; you may be ſure thoſe Seals relate not to any one of the forged Additions. And if all was blank before, &amp; all afterwards be filled with a whole falſe Commiſſion, the Seals and Miracles pretended for it, muſt needs be utterly falſe, and if real, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deviliſh; it being utterly impoſſible, that God the God of Truth, would put either his own hand, or the hand of his good Angels to the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of an untruth, and to the contradicting any Truth which he hath confirmed before.</p>
               <p>So, to prevent Deluſion, ſome care and skill muſt be uſed in underſtanding and conſtruing the voice and Signification of Miracles. For inſtance when God ſent Lions among thoſe Heatheniſh Colonies, who uſed no other Religion in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then what they had learned in <hi>Babel</hi> or in <hi>Ava.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.25. this extraordinary Judgment ſaid nothing at all to countenance what <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes had adulterated in Gods Service; for ſuch language in a Miracle ſhould contradict, and not confirm the clear Voice of God in his Law: it declared nothing but this truth, to wit, that God would have alway the Memorial of his Name kept in that Land; and that in order to this will of his, he would rather bear with any Corruption, then with the utter Abolition of his Service in that Country, till his Son ſhould come to reform it. Thus the Angel moving the water once every year at <hi>Betheſda.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> 5. or the other Angel that at one time dried up or removed twice the water, which a <hi>Novatian</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Socrat. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> Biſhop had conſecrated for the Chriſtening of a <hi>Jew,</hi> who had bin Chriſtened already, &amp; who thought of nothing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132423:29"/>elſe then of ſurprizing by this means the Liberality of Chriſtians, which then was very great upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; neither of theſe true Miracles I ſay are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, if you draw them, either to favor the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Scribes then taught in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or to countenance the long <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which this <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop with others did keep and foment in the Church. Theſe two Miracles muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own proper and fit ends, or to ſuch things as Chriſtian Truth can allow of. That of <hi>Betheſda</hi> to declare the continuance of ſome temporal Mercies upon a corrupted then, but before an elected Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and to ſignifie to all men the Bleſſing of holy Baptiſm, and the admittance into the Chriſtian Church, which was, fitly repreſented by the ſaid Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> that is the Laver of Regeneration in <hi>the Houſe of Gods Mercies.</hi> And the other, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Honor of this ſame holy <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which the <hi>Novatians</hi> kept entire, and which this wandering <hi>Jew</hi> thought to abuſe. By this means the true Miracles done in Chriſts Name (and power too) ſometimes by falſe men <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. ſhall recommend only Chriſts Goſpel, not their Iniquity who work them. No ſimple Ignorants ſhall turn the wonderful Acts of God as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaies, ſome do the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. nor the fouleſt <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> as otherwiſe they may) toward their fouleſt Blaſphemies, and whatever be don or reported to be ſo, among men of mixt and corrupted Religions, ſhall give them no ground of bragging in their Error, or Hereſie. Thus ſuppoſe (which for my part I might very well wiſh it were true) that the great Cures done anciently at the <hi>Graves</hi> of the holy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> were yet to be ſeen every day; theſe Acts of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132423:30"/>God, how great ſoever, wrought at the touching the Relics of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> or of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or of <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> would juſtifie neither <hi>Turciſm,</hi> nor any other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety now believed or practiſed in thoſe Countries; they could atteſt nothing but this, that thoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs howſoever killed, and caſt out like Dogs, were holy men: and that what they taught and died for, when they were taken for Seducers, is proved by theſe great works, to be moſt true. Thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what they taught, what they did, and what they believed; for this certainly (and this only) is atteſted by thoſe Miracles: and if the <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed yet yearly upon great holy daies at <hi>Rome,</hi> did really the greateſt Cures; theſe would aſſert S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Pauls Epistles</hi> which the Papiſts now contradict in many Points; and not the Popes Roial Power, nor the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory, nor the works of congruity, condignity, or ſupererogation, nor any other like Doctrines which are contradicted by theſe Epiſtles. But if you meet, as oft you may, with another ſort of Miracles, which, what way ſoever you turn them, do not look towards any Doctrine delivered by Chriſt or his Apoſtles; theſe can be none of thoſe, we may be ſure, which S. <hi>Mark</hi> calls <hi>following Miracles,</hi> ſuch as are properly the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ones. They may be from God nevertheleſs, and true, and good, and thankfully to be accepted, as the Providential Miracles are. But if they look or go plainly a quite croſs or contrary way; be ſure they are <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and are deſigned either to ſow, or to improve ſome other Seed, then was at the firſt Sown by Chriſts Preaching, and cultivated by his Miracles. And ſuch were thoſe true Prophecies, which

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> bids us to take heed of, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 13.1. to draw <hi>Iſrael</hi> after ſtrange Gods: ſuch were the many Signs and wonders, which <hi>Janſenius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gant</hi> affirms

Nor matters it that theſe Miracles ſeem not much leſs, then thoſe firſt were, wherewith the Goſpel was confirmed; For the Beaſt can perform great wonders. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13.

Yet there are none, but by ſome illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or other, may be ſo exactly counterfeited, that tho they have no Reality, yet will they have as much appearance to confirm Lies, as the other have to confirm the Truth. Hence comes in theſe laſt times (when the Devil hath no reſtraint to keep him from making the utmoſt uſe of his Power) the abſolute impoſſibility of diſcerning thoſe from theſe any other way, then by the end, which they aim at, to wit the reveled will of God, and the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Truth. <hi>There are ſome of the Devils Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>

They might as well, if their Intereſt would ſuffer it, find the like flaws in all the reſt: And you may eaſily do it, if you compare their own <hi>Roman,</hi> with all averted Chriſtian Miracles. For,</p>
               <p>The Miracles of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles, had in them three prime Characters, which ſet them paſt all doubt. 1. In themſelves all were very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and ſerious Works, and of a ſuitable nature beſides, both to promote the Glory of God, and to procure ſome very conſiderable good to men. 2. They did tend, and were alſo proper, to rouſe the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Infidels to the belief of ſome Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſtian Religion, as the Reſurrection, or coming of Chriſt; the accompliſhment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel. 3. And for this end, God had them wrought moſtly in ſuch remarkable times, as were ſet out by moſt expreſs Predictions, and freed by Gods reſtraining hand, from all mixture and poſſibility of Lying Wonders. The Roman Miracles, contrary-wiſe carry with them three ſuch ſad marks (or at the leaſt ſome of the three) as both viſibly diſtinguiſh them from the Chriſtian ones, and muſt needs render them ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all Chriſtians. Firſt, By their own intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal Impertinency and Frivolouſneſs. Secondly, By their general Aptneſs and Tendency to confirm rather any piece of trifling Superſtition, then any fundamental Point of Chriſtian Faith, Thirdly, By
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:132423:34"/>being done late, after the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt had bin thus abundantly confirmed over all the world by the former true Miracles, that the farther continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them had bin uſeleſs; which times were reſerved for falſe Miracles, and are branded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, with this woful Prediction, that Antichriſt ſhould then come, and enchant men with ſtrong Deluſions, and lying Wonders, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt black Character, whereas the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Miracles of God are grave and ſerious works, and do carry along with them both ſome Image of Gods Wiſdom, and ſome holy Impreſſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand that cauſes them; the modern and <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles are commonly ſuch Sports and Pranks, as can become but Fairies or Hobgoblins. What is there in the whole world more impertinent, then to make the moſt bleſſed and holy <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely out of Heaven, whence it was not heard ſhe came before, to drudg here and there about Monks, about ſick Wives, about Images &amp; ſuch like things? Who could take for a holy Soul, or a good Angel (much leſs for that ever Bleſſed Saint) that which appears under her Name like a Woman ſhewing her Breaſt,

<note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chronic. Deip. an.</hi> 1235.</note> to him (being at his Devotions) led by two Angels; who being come
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132423:35"/>within the diſtance, where S. <hi>Harman</hi> did well hear them; one of them cries out, <hi>To whom ſhall we give and marry this Virgin?</hi> the other anſwered quite as loud; <hi>To whom ſhould we, rather then to this young man?</hi> meaning <hi>Harman.</hi> Then the Angel took him by the hand, and joined it with the ſaid Virgin, with theſe ſolemn Expreſſions, <hi>O Harman, I give thee this Virgin to be thy Spouſe, in the ſame manner as once ſhe was to</hi> Joſeph; <hi>and hereafter be thou her Husband, and upon theſe terms be called</hi> Joſeph. Then at night when he was aſleep, <hi>this Queen of Heaven</hi> comes to his Bed ſide, and laying her Child, whom ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on her left Arm, into this new Bridegrooms hands, <hi>Take you charge of him,</hi> ſaies ſhe, <hi>hereafter, as once my other</hi> Joſeph <hi>did, when we three fled into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> but after all theſe good Kindneſſes, there (as 'tis uſual among Lovers) happened an unlucky diſtaſte: for this <hi>Joſeph</hi> being intruſted with the Guardianſhip of a Convent, ſhe grew Jealous of her new <hi>Joſeph</hi> (which ſhe never was of the old) as if he had taken greater care of his Convent, then of her ſelf: and being in that muſty humor, ſhe appears to him under ſuch an old ugly Face, that poor <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> thought (as well he might) it was the ſame Devil, who in former times uſed to haunt him: and cryed out frightfully, <hi>Who art thou? I am,</hi> ſaies the Apparation, <hi>I am the Keeper of this place, as you know, I was ſo before;</hi> then <hi>Joſeph Harman</hi> knowing who ſhe was by her ſweet Voice, tho much troubled at her ſowre Face. <hi>O my Roſe;</hi> quoth he, for he was uſed to call her ſo; <hi>art thou the ſame, and how cameſt thou by this old Face. I had a mind,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>to appear in your Eies, ſuch as I fear I am in your heart; where I perceive I am accounted no better then if I were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132423:36"/>an old Woman: Where are now the frequent Praiers, which I uſed to receive of thee, and which did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore render us young one to the other?</hi> With theſe, and many more reproches, ſhe ſo mortified her poor <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he quite laid aſide all the care he had of his Convent; and ſince that time had no other thought, then of making his Queen younger by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing her <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and other-like Angelical Prizes, till poor <hi>Harman</hi> got a miſchance: for when he was running too faſt, he fell down flat upon his Face, and ſtruck out two of his beſt Fore-teeth by that fall; but his Lady put them in again, both ſo faſt, and ſo dexterouſly, where they had bin, that he was well of them ever after. At another time ſhe came to his Bed, and finding him lying on that ſide, where he had bin let Blood in the Arm, ſhe turned him upon the other, and ſhew'd him how to lie and ſleep without fear of farther danger. If theſe evil Spirits dare thus appear, under the name of Chriſts bleſſed Mother, whereof Scripture gives no warning, it is no wonder if they do it under the name of Chriſt himſelf, after ſo many Prophecies. It is not the true Chriſt certainly, that being Immortal in Heaven, comes down either at every Maſs, there to lie as if he were dead, under the hand of any Prieſt; or to ſhew tricks of Activity under the ſhape of a young Child, and act among Nuns and Novices twenty ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pranks in their Churches. We are not bound to believe all; but it were hard to believe nothing, when ſo many and great Doctors, and among them ſome great Saints too, aver for truth one and the ſame thing.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula,</hi> with hundreds more, known and famous in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This great Saint aroſe from the dead twice, before ſhe died for good and all, and ſo died thrice. All her Life long ſhe had a very extraordinary gift of Miracles; for having taken upon her to ſave Souls from Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by ſuffering here what they did there; ſhe loved to throw her ſelf into all the hot Ovens or burning Fires ſhe could find, &amp; yet met with none that could burn her; ſhe would attone for Gluttons, by reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſtarve her ſelf: and while ſhe felt the great pains of a ſharp hunger, this Virgin got Milk in her Paps, and ſo found eaſe by ſucking her ſelf; ſhe did ſatisfie for proud Souls, by applying her ſelf to the worſt way of common Begging: and herein ſhe had this comfort, that when honeſt Men did give her Bread, it taſted in her mouth like Bread; otherwiſe, it taſted like Toads fleſh. To expiate all ſorts of Sins contracted by much company, this Saint reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to forſake Man-kind, and to come near none, but Beaſts; and at laſt, that ſhe might be the ſafer from all Contagion of Fleſh and Blood, ſhe parch'd her ſelf on the tops of Trees: There her thin Body being made thinner, both by continual Faſting, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132423:38"/>great fervency of Spirit, ſhe did at her Praier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract her ſelf into a round form, that was ſomwhat like a Hedg-hog. She could climb up the higheſt Trees like a Squirrel, and ſwim in Rivers like a Fiſh, till her Friends barbarous, it ſeems, and not believing all theſe Miracles, put her in Chains as a mad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and there ſhe tore ſadly her poor Body with ſtrugling hard to free her ſelf: and this ſtrugling in her Priſon, gave occaſion to more Miracles, for the Milk ſhe had in her Breaſt, turned into Oil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe did anoint her ſores; and ſomtimes alſo ſhe uſed it as Butter to ſweeten her Bread. Cardinals, and whole Towns beſides, can aver theſe Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, and make therewith the firſt kind of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Miracles.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Evidence againſt Roman Miracles, is their looking quite another way, and their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the confirmation of quite different Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, then ancient Miracles were. The laſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtian Miracles, being wrought for the moſt part at the Graves of Holy Martyrs, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more then this Truth, That the Death, the Souls, and the very Aſhes of thoſe Saints were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious before the Lord; and therefore, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith which they had believed, taught, and died for, was very true. So it remained only to enquire, what this Faith was, and what kind of Doctrine St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and other Martyrs believed and Preach'd: for nothing elſe but this can be aſſerted by their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: <hi>What is it,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Aug de Civit. l.</hi> 22. <hi>c</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>that theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles will attest but the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt?</hi> The Holy Apoſtles being alive, never confirmed by their Miracles, but what they taught;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132423:38"/>and what they taught, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you is concluded within the Law and the Prophets. You may be ſure, it went no farther then what you find in Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. This is that Faith, which once (and but once) being delivered to the Saints, was carried thro all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (and thus made Catholic) by the Almighty Breath of God, and there ſetled by his Almighty Hand, and the Miracles that followed it, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. So at this very day, tho all ſorts of Operations were continually ſeen at the Sepulcher of <hi>S. Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> they would rather confirm his Epiſtles, then the Popes Bulls. As for Roman Miracles, they do follow likewiſe Roman Doctrines, which ſometimes are quite contrary to, and alwaies quite different from the true <hi>Christian Goſpel.</hi> They would be huge books, that could contain all the Revelations and ſtrange Wonders that encourage Men in general to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> As many more are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the doing it by ſpecial waies, and at ſpecial Feaſts: for what elſe mean thoſe ſwarms of <hi>Monks,</hi> who lie hid

This amaz'd the whole Convent; but that which is more then all the reſt, <hi>St. Francis</hi> had not <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Sword in vain, for that ſame night the Biſhop had his Throat cut. What Evangelical Doctrine can be confirm'd by theſe three Wonders; Pictures, that can ſpeak and move; <hi>St. Paul,</hi> that exhorts to revenge; and a Saint, who during his Life made conſcience, as they ſay, to kill a Louſe, now can cut his Biſhops Throat: What, I ſay, can you make of this, unleſs it be this wholeſome Doctrine, That Biſhops are not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but Fryers are? All theſe, and whole Millions of other ſuch Roman Miracles, are not fit for Chriſts Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe they never were fitted for perſwading Men of the truth of Chriſts Goſpel, and therefore upon that account muſt needs proceed from any other then Chriſts Spirit.</p>
               <p>The third foul mark of Roman Miracles, is, that beſides their unchriſtian ends, they happen in ſuch ſuſpicious times, as may diſcredit the beſt that are. The Gift of Miracles being to Teachers, what both Credential Letters and Roial Colors are to public Officers, which ſignifie much with good Subjects, whilſt they know them granted to none but ſuch as the King doth really ſend; but very little, after they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132423:40"/>ſee thoſe in the hands, theſe on the backs of every dirty Carrier, who hath a mind for his own ends to counterfeit them, and rant with them. No wiſe man takes for good paiment, whatſoever hath <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> Image, after he hears of falſe Coiners who have diſperſed vaſt ſums abroad, and marked them with the ſame Stamp. We are not now in the privileged daies either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles, when neither all the Magicians could make one Louſe; nor all the <hi>Baalims</hi> could light Fire on one Altar; nor all the Workers of falſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders open their Mouth againſt Jeſus Chriſt. We live in times, when the Devils, in all Mens account, are let looſe from ſuch a reſtraint, and the Church left unguarded of ſuch a Protection: when falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets may ariſe with ſuch Propheſies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. and falſe Chriſts with ſuch Miracles, as, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, might deceive the very Elect, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.22. Now the <hi>Mirabilarians</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>run away with Christs Colours,</hi> (that is, with a permitted power of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting true Miracles) <hi>and therewith amaze poor Country People; but whoſoever hath no mind to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affrighted or cheated with this, may look to it.</hi> The glorious Works of Chriſt, of Chriſts Diſciples, and other Apoſtolical Fathers, were don in ſuch clear daies, as ſcattered and diſſipated all ſuſpicions and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132423:40"/>imaginable Clouds of Impoſture; the Devils had not ſo much as the liberty to preach the Truth, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.25. If either <hi>Simon,</hi> or <hi>Elymas,</hi> tho Sorcerers of the higheſt rank, did but offer to play their old game, you read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> how they were kept in. Thus this mighty reſtraining hand, rather then the intrinſecal greatneſs of the work was an infallible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which in thoſe daies ſhined about all true Miracles; whereas the Revelations and Feats of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs be full of ſuſpition, and noted for ſuch by all Chriſtians, ſince they came forth, when all falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets have the liberty to work them. In this horrible Confuſion either of Miracles, or Actors, none but God or a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel can well diſcern by the work it ſelf, which is the Impoſtors, and with the Saints. If the reſtoring life to a dead man, or giving ſight to one born blind, be thought to be proper to God; this may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ado counterfeited by any Devil: and as Braſs ſometimes out ſhines Gold, lying wonders may dazle our Eies as ſtrongly, as moſt true Miracles.</p>
               <p>This dark and dubious conjuncture is the ſeaſon and the very point of time, when <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles ſwatm abroad. Then the Apparitions of ſad Souls firſt begin by thouſands to come up, and to acquaint their friends with their condition under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: and what neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Prophets, nor Jeſus Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles ever thought to mind us of, ſad groaning Spirits make it their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal buſineſs to expreſs, and throng about, craving for help, for Pilgrimages, and for Maſſes. Then come Images after them, to bleed, or ſing, or mourn as occaſion requires: and the conſecrated Elements, the better to juſtifie what they are not, appear with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132423:41"/>blood, with fleſh, and even ſometimes with whole children. It paſſes all underſtanding, how the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> who kept her ſelf ſo long above, would not come down among us men, both ſooner and in fitter times. She paſſed all her daies on Earth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies keeping cloſe and quiet at home: and ſince her happy departure, I can account five hundred years, when all good Authors will juſtifie, that ſhe continued as quiet above. Here then are two huge great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, the firſt, how the bleſſed Virgin, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years of reſt, comes to have new Inclinations to beſtir her ſelf among men: and the ſecond, that ſhe ſhould conſent to take this ſuſpicious unlucky time of ſhewing her Activity, when the Devil and all his Spirits are permitted to play their Pranks. How is this Change imaginable, that ſhe, who never did appear to any one of the primitive holy Fathers (when ſhe could do it, without any ſuſpicion) would in theſe laſt and branded times ſhew her ſelf to a dirty <hi>Monk?</hi> Did not <hi>S.

               <p>THIS pretended help of men and women, who after their departure out of this world, and their being Canonized by ſome Pope, are called Saints; are another great Enchantment to keep and draw People to <hi>Rome.</hi> Their Souls are conceived to be ſtill ready to go about any buſineſs, which their worſhippers have in Heaven: and their Bodies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the leaſt of their Bones, their Clothes and their Shoes withal, can at every good occaſion work great Cures and Feats on Earth. Thus one Saint is upon this account worth as much or more then any two Angels. What ſober man therefore would not be temted, to turn a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic? and who would turn from being ſo; tho there were no other reaſon for either, then the getting, and loſing ſuch Friends? The perſwaſion of <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is, that all ſuch Souls as deſerve their Canonization at <hi>Rome,</hi> go up directly to Heaven as to a place, where, their happy Reſt from all their Labors, and an happy Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an eternal Glory with God, is not all what they expect: they muſt have alſo Government, and

And becauſe ſo much were too much for any one Saint, to manage it well; and that no Creature is capable of ſuch an Univerſal Burden, except the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> above, and the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> here below; to facilitate

                  </note> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they divide the whole among themſelves; that every one may be troubled with no more, then his proper ſhare.</p>
               <p>Firſt by this imaginary Diſtribution, they divide their Saints into Countries.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly they ſubdivide their Emploiments in theſe and other Countries, after the ſeveral ſorts of Profeſſions and Trades extant therein. For <hi>S. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and <hi>S. Christopher</hi> are thought to look to the <hi>Seamen; S. Catharine</hi> to the <hi>Scholars; S. Austin</hi> to the <hi>Divines; S.

Some others are put to equally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:132423:44"/>vile Services; as St. <hi>Anthony</hi> about Swine; St. <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> about Cows; St. <hi>Eulogius</hi> about Horſes; Saint <hi>Vendeline</hi> and S. <hi>Gallus,</hi> have the care both of Sheep and Geeſe. Judg you how gladly theſe happy Souls leave the Boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to drudg about theſe ſorts of Cattel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In theſe diſtinct Provinces, and about theſe ranks of Men and Beaſts, the <hi>Roman</hi> Saints are for the moſt part appointed to diſtinct Works, and Helps, <hi>Non omnia poſſumus omnes,</hi> that is, Every one cannot do all, ſaies one of the

This is it which they

                  </note> call the diſcreet Variety, ſo honorable to their Church, and ſo advantageous to her poor Members; when you ſhall ſee one pray to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for the Gift of Submiſſion: to St. <hi>Agnes,</hi> for Continency: to our Lady S. <hi>Anna</hi> for Wealth: to S. <hi>Margarite</hi> for Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing: to St. <hi>Rochus</hi> againſt the Plague: to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronilla</hi> againſt an Ague: to Saint <hi>Apollonia</hi> againſt the Tooth-ach: to St. <hi>Liberius</hi> againſt the Stone: and ſo to every Saint for that help that is in his way. Let no Batchellors go to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe a married Man: nor no married Man to St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he was a Batchellor: but

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:132423:45"/>of his on Tribe; a Widow to a Widow-Saint, and a Soldier to one of his Trade, for this is the humor of <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, to favor better their own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>According to this Oeconomy, there is not one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt</hi> but may pretend to march under the colors of ſeveral Saints. For example, a French Catholic born at <hi>Paris,</hi> hath as fair title as <hi>Rome</hi> can give, to the protection of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and our <hi>Lady,</hi> who generally rule that Kingdom: of St. <hi>Genevefa,</hi> that more ſpecially looks to <hi>Paris;</hi> of St. <hi>Germain</hi> or St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> if he either be born, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in thoſe Pariſhes: of St. <hi>Coſmus,</hi> and St. <hi>Damian,</hi> in caſe he do practice Phyſic: of St. <hi>Ottilia</hi> and St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> when his Ears and Eies trouble him, and of St. <hi>Mathur in</hi> alſo, if he be troubled with folly. Over and above theſe, he may be ſure of other Saints, <hi>St. Dominic, S. Celeſtin, S. Francis,</hi> and twenty more, by matriculating his Name into their Confraternities; which he may do for a ſmall matter.</p>
               <p>It is great pitty that this fancy of diſtributing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencies and Powers thus among <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, hath no better ground then that had which <hi>Julian</hi>

But as to any honeſt ground and precedent for ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, theſe two things may, and muſt be ſaid, to the everlaſting ſhame of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; The firſt is, That whereas, as long as either the Patriarchs, or the Prophets, or the Apoſtles, or any Holy and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Men ordered the Church, there never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſoul that offered to ſpeak to Men, unleſs the ſoul of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. (and in the judgment both of the Fathers, and of many <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, that appearing ſoul was a Devil;) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> brags in her time of above ten thouſand ſouls, all coming down to talk with Men, which ſouls ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be Saints. The ſecond is, That whereas neither Patriarchs, nor Prophets, nor any Apoſtles, or any Apoſtolical Holy Men, in all their dangers and diſtreſſes ever Praied to, or Worſhipped any Creature whatſoever, whether holy Angel, or holy Soul; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in a great meſure praies to, and worſhips nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, this unuſual praying to departed Saints, and this new appearing of Mens ſouls, may very well meet together. It is the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of evil ſpirits, tho neither called nor thought on, to meet Men in unlawful waies. When the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans did conſult Fowls of the Air about their good or bad ſucceſs, and ſo did bird for Propheſies; the Devils moved Ravens and Eaglesto ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, by either flying or croaking; the ſame did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:132423:46"/>ſtocks &amp; ſtones, when they did call upon Images: they made the Votaries often to ſee Viſions, when they watched for them about Tombs. And it is both very juſt with the true God to ſuffer, and pleaſing to falſe gods to do, that they, who run after dead Saints, ſhould find the ſame thing that <hi>Saul</hi> and the Witch did, when they ſought after dead Prophets.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a great preſumption to pretend to more Wiſdom, in point of ſerving God and ſaving our ſelves, then either God hath appointed, or all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles have known and taught: and it is moſt juſt and likely, that Men ſhould meet with ſtrong Deluſions, and with the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they venture upon ſlippery, &amp; unknown, and dark by-paths, where not one of Gods Saints ever durſt walk.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Admit what we know not, that the Souls of Holy Men are not confined to Heaven, and fixt there to their happy reſt; but (which

               <p>The true reaſon which makes theſe and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo ſharp againſt Praying to Angels (much more againſt Praying to Saints) as to call it Idolatry, is not becauſe the Angels cannot hear alwaies, the Saints never; for this would make praying to them no more then an idle and uſeleſs act: but mainly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, becauſe Praier, Vows, and giving of Thanks, is a main part of Gods ſervice; and therefore Saint

Now Praier is part of Gods ſervice, becauſe, if ſerious and devout (and I am ſure Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man praying to Saints is no jeſt) it preſuppoſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges in the Saint which is praied to, ſuch an infinite knowledg of Mens hearts, ſuch an Univerſal and extenſive Capacity, or rather Being, in hearing them all, alwaies, every where, and ſuch an immenſe ſufficiency and power of helping them accordingly, that to make, or to preſuppoſe, created either Saints or Angels fit perſons for to be praied to, is to make or to preſuppoſe them to be Gods. And this is the true account, wherefore calling upon God, is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Honor given to God, <hi>Call upon me, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50.15.23. becauſe it implies, and in very deed acknowledgeth the Immenſity, the Knowlege, the Mercy and Power of God: not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon him, is Atheiſm, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 79.6. And ſo calling on them, who are not Gods, is down-right Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The truth is, you may call upon a Saint, without any danger of Idolatry, if he be in ſuch a diſtance whence intelligent Creatures may without Miracle hear one another: thus the Prophets were not afraid to ſpeak to Angels, <hi>Dan. Ch.</hi> 10. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 22. <hi>Zachar.</hi> 1.9. If you did pray a Holy Man whil'ſt he is with you, to pray for you, and to recommend you to God after he is dead, perhaps this exceeds not much the ordinary power of a Saint. Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">

And, as I take it, the ſame Father asks the ſame favor of his Holy and Devout Virgins, againſt the time when their Virgin Zeal and Piety

                  </note> ſhould be crowned with its due Honor. Thus far I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, that an humble Chriſtian may not wiſh, and a created Saint may not perform: and if ſuch Praiers have any defect, it is not Idolatry, nor Superſtition perhaps, 'tis only they want an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nor is it any Idolatry to pray to your Friends by letters at any diſtant whatſoever, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles doth often ſo: and therefore I would not blame our learned Papiſts for dedicating their Books, and writing Dedicatory Letters to the moſt Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if they had Expreſſes to carry them. But if you can fancy a Saint of ſuch an unlimitted and univerſal Intelligence, as, tho he be but in one place, yet to be able to ſee, and hear what all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can ſay or do, or think, or write, or ſuffer, all the World over: and that St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> for example, hearkens and provides where he is (in Heaven I hope) to what one Sea-man praies in a Shipwrack at the Streets of <hi>Magellan;</hi> to what another wiſhes for, when he is becalmed in the South-ſea; to the cries of another, who ſees a Hurrican by the <hi>Barbado</hi>'s; to the private deſires or another, who fiſhes for Pearls by the <hi>Guyney</hi> ſhore, or Herrings by our Engliſh Coaſt, or for Whales hard by <hi>Green-land,</hi> or for Trouts in our ſmall Rivers; and whole thouſands of Paſſengers, who cry to him being Catholics, and periſhing in as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132423:48"/>many places both at once, and alwaies, as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon in all theſe places, and in all theſe times, and by all at once; and if you do fancy withal, that he underſtands beſides all this, in theſe both number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs places and exigencies, what they do both think and deſerve, in order to the returning of ſuitable reliefs and helps: I ſay, you fancy in St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> an infinite Omniſcience: wherefore they that pray to him on this account, do give him what belongs to God, and make him a complete Idol.</p>
               <p>Here Roman and ſacred Authors are at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the one from the other.

               <p>This looking-glaſs being thus broken, they run as to their beſt Refuge, to new Revelations, which, if ſufficient to the purpoſe which they are invented for, muſt ſwarm up in Heaven, as thick and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as there are Praiers made to Saints under the Dominion of <hi>Rome.</hi> At this rate, whenſoever one ſaies <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> or another <hi>St. Aegidi,</hi> or another ſome other Praier, God muſt inform the Saint who it is that praies to him, to what purpoſe, and with what Heart, or elſe it is a hundred to one if the Saint hears a word of it.

Whenſoever the Pope calls on <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or a Cardinal on <hi>S.

Well, Praier to Saints includes theſe ſins in its moſt plauſible Practice, when 'tis no more then calling on the bleſſed Saints, that they be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to mediate, and to intercede in their Praiers for us to God, which is the cheating notion under which Men, aſhamed of what they do, would fain diſguiſe their Praying to Souls and Angels with the colour of doing

Secondly, tho they, or at the leaſt the Virgin had it, yet this ſending of Angels could not be applied but to ſome few private Services; as when ſome ſay, 'twas not her ſelf but ſome Angel, whom ſhe had ſent for her, but to counterfeit the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to ſave the credit of a <hi>Nun</hi> for the ſpace of nine whole Years, when ſhe was all the while ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling up and down in Bawdy-houſes; that it was not her ſelf, but an Angel who ran Races, and fought Battels in the ſhape of her Worſhippers being then at Maſs. Some are alſo pleaſed to ſay, that every Saturday ſhe goes down to Purgatory, not by her ſelf, but by her Proxy, for the reſcuing thence of ſome Souls. But none of her Hiſtorians will aver, that it was a Deputy, or any other but her ſelf who did hug and kiſs <hi>St. Bernard, St. Dominic,</hi> and <hi>St. Alain,</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions; who did once ride behind a Knight, in the ſhape of a Woman, in order to ſurprize the Devil; or who in a dark tempeſtuous night was really met by two wandering Travellers in a Forreſt, with <hi>St. Michael,</hi> and <hi>St. Peter.</hi> It is ſhe, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you will believe what ſhe ſaies, who now and then will call her ſelf the Mother of Grace and Mercies; who comes often to viſit Churches with ſweet Perfumes, or Holy Waters, or whole Baskets of Holy Roſes, or white and black Hoods for her Chaplains. And accordingly it is ſhe her ſelf, and not her Angel, that is adored in all the places where ſhe appears. No man praies either to her, or to any other Saint or Angel, upon any conſiderable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:132423:52"/>but thinks to have her and them preſent, and ſo the very ſame conceit of an Univerſal Power and Preſence (eſſential Attributes of God) which makes them willing to pray to Saints, muſt needs make them Idolaters in praying thus.</p>
               <p>This impious worſhip is an Abuſe of what was don ſometimes to God, in the primitive times, at the Graves of his own Martyrs: and no wonder, if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men could turn the Miracles and Mercies of God, as they can all other good things, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is well known, how many wonders were wrought at the Sepulchers of holy Martyrs, as one at the ſhadow of S. <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 13. and at the Bones of the holy Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.21. Theſe Miracles were to thoſe Saints in ſome meſure, what the glorious <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> had bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to their Savior, to wit, high <hi>Declarations</hi> from above, that their Souls and Bodies, however they had appeared vile in the Eies of their Murderers, were pretious in the ſight of God; and that what they had believed, taught and ſigned as it were with their own Blood, were both true Doctrines, &amp; good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in order to Salvation. And theſe extraordinary Marks of Gods favor on their Perſons, and Seals of truth to their belief, as they were principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in behalfs of Infidels, ſo they moſtly and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt continued in thoſe parts of the world, as <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>

It is well known alſo, how at the ſame time, which was a time of generall and cruel perſecutions, the holy Zeal and Death of the Martyrs, as it was marked out, as it were, by the finger of God in his Miracles; ſo it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:132423:53"/>was exalted both to their own praiſe and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of others, by the Chriſtians in all Churches. The higheſt ſtrains of Eloquence, which the Fathers had, were ſpent in the magnifying of Martyrs. They ſet down their Names in their beſt Church Records; and rehearſed them duly in their ſolemn Euchariſts and public praiſes to their Savior: They gave the moſt honorable Burial they could in thoſe ſad times to their bodies: and having no Churches then, they made their graves their moſt ordinary Places of Meeting, to declare before all the world, that by this reſorting to their Sepulchers, they prepared themſelves to their Death. In a word they did what they could to bring both themſelves and their Flocks to love and admire thoſe holy Souls, that ſo both themſelves and others might be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to follow them. <hi>Bleſs and esteem moſt ſincerely,</hi> ſaies S.

               <p>This was enough to vindicate the Truth of God, and the true meaning of his Church, as to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor due to his Saints.

This is the very ſelf ſame Argument, which the heatheniſh Philoſophers mainly objected to the Fathers: and to which the Fathers gave two ſuch Anſwers as at once may ſtop equally both the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Mouths; the one is that

                     <hi>ſaies he,</hi> we have it, when by pious lives and praiers, we do addreſs our ſelves to God. For as the motion of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow muſt needs follow that of the Bodies, what way ſoever theſe will turn; let us know this, that if we move God towards us, we ſhall get by the ſame means all the good Angels, Souls, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be our Friends; and which is more, actual helpers, both by praiers and other waies; for theſe bleſſed Spirits take moſt eſpecial notice of men qualified for Gods favor. And I dare ſay confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that whoſoever praies to God devoutly, hath whole Legions of holy Angels at the ſame time praying for him, without his deſiring them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:132423:55"/>to do ſo.</q> This antient Author is the firſt who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſay, That the Saints might perhaps pray and act for us: and yet he is as expreſs as any other, to direct men to God by Chriſt alone, and to keep them from Praying to Angels and Saints.</p>
               <p>The other main Ground common to Pagans and Papiſts, for Praying, thoſe to their Gods, theſe to their Saints, is either the falſe Allegation, or the falſe Conſtruction of Miracles. This every one knows, who knows them both. Whereas when the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Saints were at the beſt, that is, during the three Primitive hundred years, they never tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtians any farther, then to go and to pray to God in thoſe places where they were wrought, and where Praiers had ſomtimes very extraordinary returns; there they might perhaps wiſh to God, that he would hear in their behalf, the general Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which theſe Souls moſt probably offer to God, for the afflicted members of his Church. <hi>But where is the worthy Prelate or Christian</hi> (ſaith

The Miracles don by Holy Men did ſet, as it were, the Seal of God upon the Goſpel which they believed, and upon the Worſhip which they both promoted and died for, therefore we muſt believe and worſhip as they did. If they did ſet alſo, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they did, ſome Marks of Reverence on their Perſons, and their Memory, 'twas not to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they ſhould be either adored or praied to. We do not read that true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ever praied to the dead Prophet, for the great Miracle wrought at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:132423:55"/>his Tomb; nor that Chriſtians ever worſhip'd the living Apoſtles, for all the ſigns wrought by their hands, and ſometimes at their very ſhadow. S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostom</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>S. Chryſoſt. ad Pop. Antioch. Hom.</hi> 1.</note> aſſures me, that God kept them moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly under ſome ſenſible Infirmity, which they could not eaſe themſelves of, as the ill Stomach of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the troubleſom Angel about St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Glory of their Miracles might wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on Chriſts Power, and that nothing of it might be abuſed to the admiration of their Perſons. But all is in vain to ſave thoſe Men, who have a mind to loſe themſelves. Pagans in ſpight of all will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the living Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. and Papiſts will pray to dead Saints. The Miracles of God muſt be wreſted, to countenance theſe Mens folly; and to uſe the words of an ancient Father
<note n="q" place="bottom">S. Chryſ. Ibid.</note> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, here obſerve the Wiles of Satan; Chriſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploies both at once, his Apoſtles, and his Miracles to deſtroy all Idolatry from among Men; and Pagans and Papiſts make uſe of both to bring it in.</p>
               <p>This manner of calling on Saints, is both unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and unjuſt, on all the ſides that you can take it. Firſt, It transfers on Creatures that Prerogative of Gods glory, and that ſpecial part of his Worſhip, which in Holy Scriptures doth comprehend his whole Service. Secondly, It makes Saints to be what the Holy Ghoſt alone is, ſearchers of Mens Hearts and Thoughts, and preſent over all the World; if not, How can they perceive mental Praiers? Thirdly, if you ſuppoſe, that night and day God is reveling to them what Men do, and what they would have, it forges another Impiety, and make God a perpetual
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:132423:56"/>Clerk, Mediator, and Drudg to his own Saints. Fourthly, It intrudes into Chriſts Office, as many Mediators to intercede with God for Men, both by their Sufferings and their Merits, as there are with him Saints and Angels, whereas the Church knows none but one. Fifthly, It quite diſables the Church from all poſſibility of aſſerting Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſts Divine Nature, by their uſual Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to wit, <hi>That God is in Scripture praied to, and, that the Holy Ghost is every where;</hi> or it proves Saints to have it alſo. Sixthly, As it is practiced by the devouteſt Perſons of <hi>Rome,</hi> it complements the Saints with ſuch Praiers, ſuch Expreſſions, and ſuch Services, as you may ſafely challenge <hi>Melchiſedec, Moſes, David,</hi> and all the Prophets and Apoſtles, to magnifie God Almighty with any better.</p>
               <p>You may be ſure that the Papiſts will diſown this, becauſe their own diſcretion ſuffers them not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow more among ſtrangers then they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to make good. But where Maſs is the reigning Service, there Books, and Mouths, and if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the very ſtones of their Altars, Churches, and Images do ſpeak it out: and judg what Religious Worſhip that is, which modeſt Men muſt flatly deny, or palliate and excuſe.

               </p>
               <p>But when the Papiſts are amongſt us, tho they keep ſtill their hearty thoughts, they do quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Language; they are aſhamed to ſay in <hi>England,</hi> what they are proud to do at <hi>Rome.</hi> If you believe what they ſay here, it was never heard in their Church, that they muſt adore any Saint,
<note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cenſura Colon. p.</hi> 228.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by chance it be in that ſenſe, in which <hi>Jacob</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored his Brother, and <hi>Abigail,</hi> King <hi>David:</hi> which is no Divine honor at all; but only ſuch a reverence, as is deferred
<note n="h" place="bottom">Coſter. in Enchirid.</note> to Kings, or Fathers, or ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Perſons; and therefore, (and juſtly too) why not to Saints? And if you be inquiſitive, and preſs them farther about this Point, then they will run out into ſo many Diſtinctions and terms of Art as will puzle any Lay-man: <hi>Dulia, Latria, hyperdulia; Abſolute and Relative Worſhip; Divine Adoration, and bordering upon Divine; Godhead eſſential,</hi> and <hi>Godhead participated:</hi> ſo that it will go very hard with them, if they do not leave him whom they pretend to ſatisfie, as ignorant, and more confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:132423:72"/>then he was before. They will tell you, that they intend not, either to adore the Virgin, or to adore her otherwiſe then reſpectively; that it is in a mere relation to her Son: and thoſe Intentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hearts, it is impoſſible there to ſearch out, either the Truth, or the untruth of what they ſay. But if you look to what they do, inſtead of heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to what they ſay; their moſt ſolemn and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Devotions have ſuch a plain and real language, as muſt declare to all the world, both what their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is in it ſelf, and what you may beſt think of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt they beſtow and accumulate upon the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin all the beſt Titles, which both in the Church, and in the Scripture are proper to God. For in their moſt ſolemn Devotions, ſhe is a She <hi>God,</hi> a She <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior;</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of Queens, the Fountain of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Ladder, and Gate of Heaven, &amp;c. And it were great folly in us, to think that they do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip her, according to what they call her; ſince it is not in ſuch Rencounters, that men uſe to play the Hypocrites.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, in their ordinary Praiers, and Praiſes and Giving of Thanks, they do moſt commonly join her with God: <hi>Jeſu Maria</hi> comes in one word out of their Mouths; and <hi>Glory be to God, and to the bleſſed Virgin;</hi> is but one compleat Doxologie, at the end of moſt of their Books. Now ſuch an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation as this, is in the judgment of the Fathers, a clear Evidence of being God. Thus they prove

The ſtrength of their Demonſtration conſiſts in this, that in all thoſe daies, both when the Prophets and Apoſtles did write the Holy Scriptures; and when the holy Fathers did maintain the Faith which is contained in them; no man was ſeen or heard pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Such was the known Catholic Faith, and Profeſſion of the Primitive times; for otherwiſe judicious and learned Men would not have produced it in that manner, as an undoubted Evidence againſt ſuch ſubtil and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous adverſaries. Now both the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith and practice taking a quite contrary way; we, I hope, are more bound to think, that the Papiſts, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this, are Idolaters; then that the holy Fathers, who went on in that, were very Fools.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Papiſts apply to the Virgin the moſt illuſtrious Places of Scripture, that belong directly to Chriſt: and by this means, either diſable all true Chriſtians, from the poſſibility of proving
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:132423:73"/>by the Scriptures, that He is God; or prove as well, that She is ſo too. I will mention out of many, but few Inſtances. Every word almoſt of the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which doth deſcribe the Eternal Wiſdom of God, which by the Fathers is applied to Chriſt alone; and which is none of the leaſt cogent Mediums they ſtand upon, to demonſtrate him to be that true eſſential and uncreated Wiſdom, is now turned another way,
<note n="n" place="bottom">Vid. Salazar. in Prov.</note> to deifie their Virgin.

               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, They allow her a whole Pſalter,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Pſalter. S.

For Example, in the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bleſſed be the Man, &amp;c.</hi> it begins thus, <hi>Bleſſed be the Man that loves thy name, O Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> Mary: <hi>Thy mercy ſhall comfort his Soul,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond, <hi>Why do the Heathen,</hi> &amp;c? hath it thus, <hi>Why do our Enemies imagine vain things againſt us?

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:132423:74"/>all Generations. Glorifie her, O all ye Nations, &amp;c.</hi> The 16. thus, <hi>Save me, O Lady, for I have put my truſt in thee, &amp;c.</hi> The 19. thus, <hi>The Heavens do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy glory, O Virgin, &amp;c.</hi> The 29. thus, <hi>Bring to our Lady, O ye Sons of God, bring praiſe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to our Lady. Give ſtrength to thy Servants, O holy Mother, and bleſs them that magnifie thee. Let Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth bleſs thee, the Sea, and all the corners of the World, &amp;c.</hi> The 42. thus, <hi>Like as the Hart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the water Brooks, ſo longs my Soul after thy love, O holy Virgin: for thou art the Mother of my life, the Nurſe and reſtauration of my fleſh, and both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of my Salvation, &amp;c.</hi> The 44. thus, <hi>We have heard with our ears, O Lady, and our Fathers have told us, that thy Merits are ineffable, and thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wonderful: Thy Virtues are innumerable, and thy Mercies ineſtimable. Rejoice in her, O my ſoul, for many good things are laid up for them that praiſe her. Bleſſed be thou, O Queen of Angels, &amp;c.</hi> The 51. thus, <hi>Have mercy on me, Lady, who art call'd the Mother of Mercies, and according to the Bowels of thy Compaſſions, make me clean from all mine Iniquities. Pour thy Grace upon me, and withdraw not thy uſual Mercies from me, &amp;c.</hi> The 68. thus, <hi>Let</hi> Mary <hi>ariſe, and let all her Enemies be cruſh'd under her feet, &amp;c.</hi> The 72. thus, <hi>Give the King thy judgments, O Lord, and thy Mercy to the Queen his Mother: Salvation and life, O Lady, are in thy hand, perpetual Joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eternity, &amp;c.</hi> The 73. thus, <hi>Truly God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto Iſrael, even to ſuch as worſhip his Mother, &amp;c.</hi> The 84. <hi>O how amiable are thy Dwellings, O La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:132423:75"/>of Hoſts, &amp;c.</hi> The 92. <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks, and confeſs to the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and to ſing Praiſes to her Glory: to tell of her Merits that rejoice the heart, and to imitate her Works, which rejoice the Angels, &amp;c.</hi> The 94. <hi>It is the Lord God, to whom Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongs, but thou art the Mother of Mercy, who turneſt him to compaſſion.</hi> The 95. thus, <hi>O come, let us ſing to our Lady, let us heartily rejoice in the Virgin our ſhe Savior.</hi> The 103. <hi>Praiſe the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>O my Soul, and all that is in me, praiſe and glorifie her name, &amp;c.</hi> The 110. thus, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lady, Mother, ſit thou at my right hand. Be thou reigning with me. Have mercy upon me, O Lady, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſplendor: enlighten me O thou Mother of Truth and Virtue, &amp;c.</hi> The 117. <hi>O praiſe the Lady, all ye Heathen; glorifie her, all ye Nations, for her Merciful kindneſs remains upon us for ever: whoſoever will ſerve her, ſhall be juſtified: but whoſoever neglects her, ſhall die in his ſins, &amp;c.</hi> The 144. begins thus, <hi>Bleſſed be our Lady, who teaches her Servants to fight, &amp;c.</hi> The 148. thus, <hi>O praiſe our Lady of Heaven, praiſe her in the height. Praiſe her Sun and Moon.</hi> And ſo all along to the very laſt, <hi>O praiſe the Lady in her Holineſs: praiſe her in her Virtues and Miracles. Let every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or every thing that hath breath, praiſe our Lady.</hi> This Service goes under the name of a Superangelical and Seraphical Doctor, a Roman Saint, and a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beſides, whom they call St. <hi>Bonaventura?</hi> Give this Worſhip what name you pleaſe, it is all that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other Prophets, could beſtow on the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now when the ſame is beſtowed upon a holy Creature, how great and holy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:132423:75"/>ſoever, yet a Creature, judge what it is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Leſt the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any kind of honor from Men, where the Lady had not her ſhare: what ever more eminent pieces of Divine Service they can find ſcattered in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they will be ſure to give it her. For example, that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32. <hi>Give ear, O ye Heavens, to what I will ſpeak of the Virgin</hi> Mary. <hi>Magnifie her with me, &amp;c. O perverſe and crooked Generation! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg our Lady for thy ſhe Savior: Is ſhe not thy Mother, that hath begotten thee in Faith? If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakeſt her, thou art no friend unto our Soveraign</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. <hi>O that thou wert wiſe, and wouldeſt conſider thy laſt end. As an Infant cannot live without his Nurſe, no more canſt thou be ſaved without this our Lady. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy Soul thirſt after her, and do not leave her till ſhe hath bleſſed thee. Let thy mouth be filled with her praiſe, and ſing of her greatneſs all the day long.</hi> That of the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> at the <hi>red Sea,</hi> Exod. 15. <hi>Let us ſing to our glorious Lady the Virgin</hi> Mary: <hi>Our Lady is Almighty: Her name is next to God: She hath thrown into the Sea the Chariots of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>&amp; his Hoſt, &amp;c. O Lady, thou haſt delivered my Soul from the Lion. O my deareſt Lady, cover thou me, as a Hen doth, &amp;c. I am all thine, and all I have is thine: I will put thee as a ſignet upon my heart, &amp;c.</hi> That of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 12. <hi>I will ſing to thee, O Lady, &amp;c. for thou haſt comforted me: my Lady is my Savior, I will truſt in thee, and will not fear. Thou art my ſtrength in the Lord, and art become my Salvation: with joy will I draw Waters out of thy brook, and I will call upon thy name alwaies, &amp;c.</hi> That of King <hi>Hezekias,</hi> in

Save us from all our Enemies, &amp;c. and perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers and us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, may ſerve thee without fear, &amp;c. And thou</hi> Mary <hi>ſhalt be called the Propheteſs of the Higheſt, by whom he hath given the knowledg of Salvation, &amp;c.

Let Sion and Jeruſalem rejoice and praiſe</hi> Mary, <hi>for ſhe is the greateſt among the Ladies of Iſrael: She makes poor, and ſhe makes rich: She brings low, and ſhe lifts up on high.

It is not a Grave, it is an Altar which ſhe (or rather a quite other Spirit under her Name) calls for. Go, ſaies that Ambitious Spirit, <hi>and get me</hi>

If God and Chriſt have not enough, then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and the Holy Fathers are much to blame, who gave no more: and if they did and gave as much as could make up all the ſervice, which God then required at their hands; and which now another Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly a Creature, requires at the hands of Papiſts; let the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God be the Judge, both what that proud Creature is that craves as much as God ever had: and what theſe Catholics are, that will give it. For what they plead, is ſoon wiped off.</p>
               <p>Here a Woman ſtands accuſed of lying every night with her Neighbor: She cannot at all deny the Fact; but ſhe maintains, that the Fact is not Adultery; becauſe ſhe never lies with him, as with her Husband, but alwaies as her dear Husbands Cozen and dear Relation.

Between theſe two guilty Perſons ſtands alſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic charged with the ſame; he cannot deny but he hath <hi>Churches, Altars, Vows, Bibles, Pſalters, Oblations</hi>

But this moves him not at all; he ſtoutly clears himſelf (he thinks) of all, by once ſaying, that he neither honors nor adores with all theſe things the Bleſſed Virgin, as he doth God, whom he knows to be her Creator, but as a holy Woman, whom he knows to be his Creature. By this Reckoning none of the three, let them do whatever they will in the way of either Carnal or Spiritual whoredom, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of being guilty; as long as they have but ſo much wit, as to diſtinguiſh, the firſt, a Cozen from a Husband: the ſecond, a Moon, from a Sun: and the third; a <hi>Woman,</hi> from <hi>God Almighty.</hi> Whereas, by their very pleading and excuſing of themſelves, they are found to be twice Idolaters. 1. By their Act, which they confeſs; for they transfer on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what is due to God alone. 2. Secondly by their own knowledg; for all what can be don to God (in point of viſible worſhip, which is all that men can take notice of) they willingly and voluntarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to others, whom they know to be Creatures.

In good earneſt, can an infallible Church, can a true Church be drawn away to new Services, upon the account of ſuch Tales? Or if theſe Tales and hundred other, as bad or worſe, be true ſtories, (as they may be, and I am not he that will diſpute it) what muſt we think of that Spirit, which is pleaſed to entice us to his Service upon ſuch Grounds?</p>
               <p>This matter proves as bad again, in the Point of Altars and Churches. Firſt it cannot be a good Spirit, if created, that calls for either Altars, or Churches. Secondly, it is not a good Spirit neither,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:132423:82"/>that calls for them, by unbecoming, ridiculous, and jugling waies. Thirdly, 'Tis not a true Religion, or a true Church that yields to that Spirit what he calls for, both on thoſe accounts, and by thoſe waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such Spirits, what name ſoever they take, are to be ſhrewdly ſuſpected, who call for Churches, Vows, Altars, Offerings, and all ſuch other ſacred ſervices, as clearly belong to God alone. And in expreſs terms, Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> makes no doubt

And when ſome have thought of deferring alſo to them that honor, they forbad them, and commanded them to do it to him, to whom alone they know that it can be lawfully done.

                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 19.</note> Devils never cared for the Blood or ſmell of ſlain Beaſts, upon any other account, then becauſe ſuch Sacrifices were in thoſe daies the Expreſſions of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; as now ſurely Churches and Maſſes are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſame end, and therefore as much at the leaſt, if not more deſirable and pleaſing to them. Who doubts, but all the Gold and Silver Utenſils, which you ſhall find at <hi>Lauretta,</hi> may be as rich Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as all that was once at <hi>Delphi?</hi> And let any Jeweller tell me, whether one of thoſe many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, which are daily by formal Vows ſent and preſented to that Goddeſs, would not buy the beſt Bull or Ram, that ever was at any time Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> To follow the Roman accounts, one Maſs is better then all what both <hi>Delphi</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> had together: and if the Devils anciently craved for the ſlaughter of ſilly Beaſts, becauſe ſuch was the ſolemn worſhip of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> how proud may they be now, to ſee upon their Altars the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which tho in very deed but a Wafer, yet in the Opinion of Papiſts, is the moſt ſolemn Worſhip of <hi>Rome?</hi> You will ſay, that this Fleſh or Wafer is not ſacrificed to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> true indeed, but it is worſe; for it is ſacrificed to God for her ſake, <hi>in honorem Mariae.</hi> Thus, when I make much of a Stranger for my Friends ſake, the Stranger hath the entertainment: and God, upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Principles, hath the Sacrifice or the Maſs: but the Friend, and the good Lady, are the main end, and

               <p>Secondly, This fear and ſuſpicion is ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced to be plain truth, by the undecent and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh waies which this pretended Goddeſs takes, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure Men to theſe Services. Commonly, to compaſs her ends, ſhe comes down from Heaven it ſeems, but however from above the Clouds, either with new Hoods for Friars; or Miters and Gowns for Biſhops; or Roſes and Garlands for Maids; or Pots of Holy Water to ſprinkle them all. When ſhe hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:132423:84"/>them with theſe Favors, that they may not want what to ſing, nor what to preach and do in her ſervice, ſhe tells them ſhe is the Queen of Heaven, and the very Mother of Grace; and that they ſhall find her to be ſo, if they go but to ſuch an Image, and there build for her an Altar, or ſing to her honor <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> &amp;c. or ſome other-like Godly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. Often times before ſhe leaves them, ſhe will kiſs them, or ſhew them her fine Breaſts; ſomtimes give a taſt of her Milk, or acknowledg them for her Husbands; at the leaſt, before her parting, ſhe is ſure to perfume the Room, and ſtroak them on their Heads, and leave them ſome good Books that will teach them to ſing her Praiſes. The ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all, is this: after ſhe hath well bewitched them, what with favor, what with perfumes, they muſt pray to her both day and night; and, if they can, build her a Church or a Chappel, or do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her honor. To promote this, Devout Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall meet with Images lying here and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Brambles, under Trees, and under Ground, either crying, or laughing, or doing ſome other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that needs muſt be taken notice of: and when Men think, that theſe Images call on them merely for ſuccor, to help them out of thoſe obſcure places into ſome neighboring Church, it proves commonly a miſtake; for either the little Image grows ſo heavy that it is impoſſible to remove it; or if you remove it twenty times, you ſhall find it the next Morning in the ſame place where it was before: and this is the ordinary token, that there is the place where a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or a great Church, or at the leaſt an Altar, muſt needs be builded. This good Lady hath in the World hundreds of Churches and Chappels, both
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:132423:84"/>made and ſerved by this device. I need not tell you where I learn this, for no wiſe Catholic will deny it, or he ſhall do it to his ſhame. When the Building muſt be a work of greater charge and importance, then will ſhe take the trouble of beſtirring her ſelf more vigorouſly about it; for in that caſe, either ſhe will ſet up ſome great Ladder, reaching from the ground up to Heaven, and there <hi>beſpeak a</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, I ſaid that it is a ſtrange Religion, that ſteers it ſelf, and is guided by ſuch abſurd Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:132423:85"/>time brag amongſt Men of what ſhe is, and allure them with Smiles and Kiſſes, to Worſhip her as a Goddeſs. Or in caſe their Reaſon were ſo weak, and ſo inveigled with Cuſtom, as not to be able to ſee ſo much; if inſtead of Conſecrated Wafers, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water, and Signs of the Croſs, which they try Evil Spirits with, and which thoſe Devils do not care for, they would but conſult the Example of the former Ages, and the practice of all Faithful People, much above four thouſand Years; there they might ſee that the Church of God ever had Angels, had Saints, had Deliverers, and ſometimes Workers of great Miracles, and yet never had one Altar, nor one Chappel, nor one Image to ſerve them with: And that if the very beſt of all their either Saints or Angels, had called for any ſuch Service, they would have thought him qualified rather for Execration, then for Worſhip.

But then the Goddeſs comes by night, and falls foul upon the Prelat; and being ſeconded by an Angel, who had a burning Taper in one hand, and a luſty whip in the other: <hi>What,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>wrong'ſt thou my Chaplain, and takest thou from him what thou didſt not give?</hi> At laſt, after many ſound ſtripes, the Biſhop being taught good manners, was glad to cry out <hi>peccavi,</hi> and to reſtore to that worthy Man, the ſtipends which he had kept from him.</p>
               <p>This is but a temporal Concern; but here is one which is Eternal. It is ſomewhat long, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all Men to know it, and I have it from the ſame Saint
<note n="k" place="bottom">Card. Damian. ſupra.</note>. An ugly Fellow named <hi>Baſſus,</hi> who died a ſudden death, had the good luck to die ſo in coming from one of our Ladies Churches. He having bin in his Coffin the greateſt part of the night after his death, roſe up out of it ſuddenly, both affrighted, and affrighting others: for with a terrible tone he cried for Praiers &amp; Litanies, to ſcare away thoſe ugly Spirits who watch'd for him about the Room: and at laſt being come to himſelf (for <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and Holy Water, had ſoon frighted the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils away) when my poor Soul, ſaies he, parted from me, preſently came on ſome black Troopers; this Fellow, ſaid they, is our prize, for he hath ever lived after the Fleſh, and never knew what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:132423:92"/>was. His good Angel could ſay nothing, but that he was dead in the ſervice of their Miſtreſs the Queen of Heaven, and that whoſoever hath her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, cannot periſh by the power of any Judg. To this they make bold to reply, that God being Juſt, would do nothing for a Sinner to their prejudice; and thereupon the Devils grew ſo earneſt after their Prey, and the Angels, on the other ſide, ſo remiſs in keeping their charge, that the Wretch was upon the point of being given up, as he deſerved; when, behold the Queen of Heaven came among them, and an Army of Celeſtial Soldiers with her, and with ſuch a ſplendor beſides, that the Devils durſt not look up. Nevertheleſs, with reverence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt the wrong which the former Angels had done them, in detaining from them their juſt Prey; and that if God and ſhe were juſt, they could not reſcue ſuch a ſinner out of their hands. The Queen confeſſed he had bin ſo, but yet her Son and Lord would never ſuffer, that one, who had ended his daies in her ſervice, as this Fellow had done in going to viſit her Church, ſhould ever ſuffer their Cruelty: and withal he had confeſſed, tho he had not the time to do Penance. Hence the Devil took a fit time to tell her what a Villain he was, and what ugly Abomination he had never confeſſed (and that is true, ſaies the revived Man of himſelf) at which the Mother of Mercy ſtarted: but at laſt, after a kind of modeſt ſilence in reverence to this plain truth, having ſomewhat recovered her ſelf; It is as you ſay, ſaies ſhe, but yet of courſe Mercy goes before Judgment. Go back again to thy Body, ſaies ſhe to him, and then confeſs to ſuch a Prieſt (whom ſhe named) what theſe Spirits lay to thy charge;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:132423:93"/>and in my name charge ſuch Friars, (whom ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo) to take upon them thy Penance. Then come again without delay, for I will not ſtir hence till thou come. The Raſcal being confeſſed, ſaies the Cardinal <hi>Damian,</hi> and the Holy Friars having taken upon themſelves the ſatisfaction enjoined him by the Confeſſor, died again, but as ſweetly, as if he had but fallen aſleep. A happy Sinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who can find ſuch a Savioreſs, as will give way to all his Crimes, and ſecure him from puniſhment. Men troubled in their Conſciences, and unwilling to leave their ſins, do not conſider the Abſurdity, tho viſible, in all ſuch Stories, but ſee their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency; and what could pleaſe and fit then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then ſuch a protecting Goddeſs?</p>
               <p>Add to this Enchantment of daily Praiers to the Virgin, the Devotion of Faſting and Hearing one Maſs to her Honor every Saturday; the Temtation will be ended, and your Soul ſafe.

But this of 150 <hi>Aves,</hi> and 15 <hi>Paters,</hi> both run over devoutly, and meditated on together, is a quite other kind of thing, as well in worth, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.

I am as unwilling as any man to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf with Romances. But let us not be loth to hear, what men turning Papiſts are given over to believe.</p>
               <p>When firſt St. <hi>Dominic</hi> began to preach this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> there fell a <hi>Demoniac</hi>

Wherefore the Saint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:132423:95"/>well pleaſed with this occaſion of confirming by ſome ſtrange Feats, what he had Preached, leaves his Sermon; and in the Name, ſaies he, both of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of her Service, which I ſtand for, O Helliſh Spirits I command you, to anſwer me to theſe Queſtions. 1. You muſt tell me, wherefore you torment this poor Man, and how many you are in him. <hi>Wo unto us,</hi> ſay the Spirits, <hi>it is not in our power to reſiſt this Adjuration:</hi> We have taken hold of him, both becauſe of his Irreverence to the Virgin Mother of God, (tho we hate her as much as he doth) &amp; becauſe of his unbelief: for ever ſince this Month and more, that thou art Preaching the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> this Heretic hath continued as incredulous as before. Now we are fifteen thouſand Devils in him, becauſe he did blaſpheme againſt the <hi>Roſary,</hi> whereof the <hi>Ave</hi> contains five words, and the whole Pſalter fifteen <hi>Paters,</hi> that this Raſcal offered to laugh at. 2. Saies <hi>St. Dominic,</hi> by this <hi>Roſary</hi> you muſt tell me, Whether all that I have Preached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, be true or not. Then all the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall to fearful Curſings and Howlings, why did we not choak this baſe Fellow when we took him? Now it is too late, for this Holy Man holds us in fiery Chains, <hi>ignitis Catenis,</hi> and forces us to ſpeak the truth. <hi>So hear ye all Men and Women, Whatever this our bitter enemy hath ſpoken, either of</hi> Mary, <hi>or of her</hi> Roſary, <hi>is very true; and unleſs ye believe it, you ſhall periſh.</hi> 3. Thirdly, ſaies <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic,</hi> you muſt tell me, Who is the Man whom you hate moſt. Thee, ſay the Devils, <hi>for with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Praiers, thou ſheweſt every one the way of getting to Paradiſe, and eſcaping out of our Hands.</hi> Then the Saint being modeſt at this, and confeſſing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:132423:95"/>himſelf a great ſinner: <hi>Curſed be,</hi> ſay they, <hi>this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, which puts us all to this torture.</hi> 4. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>S. Dominic</hi> throwing his Mantle about this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacs Neck, which made him ſpue ugly matter; I muſt, ſaies he, know of you, who is the greateſt Saint in Heaven, whom you fear moſt, and whom Men ought to love and ſerve beſt. At this Query, the Devils roared ſo horribly, that all the People fell to the ground: <hi>O Dominic, Dominic,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>have ſome compaſſion; be content with what Hell makes us ſuffer, and do not put us to new Torments. At the leaſt, we beſeech thee, do not force us to anſwer to this publicly.</hi> (it ſeems they would have condeſcended to an Auricular Confeſſion.) Nay, ſaies <hi>Dominic,</hi> but you ſhall give a clear and public anſwer. But they being a little ſtubborn, <hi>St. Dominic</hi> falls on his knees, and thus praies to the Virgin <hi>Mary: O moſt excellent Virgin, by the Power of this thy Pſalter, I beſeech thee make theſe Enemies of Mankind to ſatisfy my Queſtion.</hi> At this Praier, preſently Flames of Fire burſt out at the Mouth of the poor Wretch: and all the Devils cried out, by the Paſſion of Chriſt, the Merits of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Suffrages of the Holy Church, we beſeech thee, O <hi>Dominic,</hi> do not keep us here any longer. The Holy Angels can revele to thee at any time what thou wilt know; and as for us, we are ſuch Liars, as no Chriſtian can believe us. But the Saint fell to another Praier, <hi>O worthieſt Mother of Wiſdom, for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this good People, who have learned in this</hi> Roſary <hi>to ſalute thee, force thou theſe Enemies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us the plain truth.</hi> He had ſcarce made an end of Praying, when behold, ſhe comes with a Troop of above an hundred Angels armed with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:132423:96"/>weapons; and in the midſt of them the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a golden Rod fell foul on the Devils Backs. Then fell all the Devils to new howlings; <hi>O Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning foe,</hi> who emtieſt Hell, and makeſt the beſt way to Heaven; thou doſt force us againſt our will to ſpeak out truth, and our own Confuſion. Hear ye therefore, O Chriſtians; <hi>This Mother of Chriſt is too potent to preſerve her devout Servants from ever falling into our hands. It is ſhe, who breaks all our Plots: and we confeſs, that whoſoever keeps to her Adoration and Service, can never be damned with us; we never can prevail againſt any one of her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. She ſaves many againſt our Rights, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment of Death; and were it not that ſhe fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates all our Deſigns, we might have long ago made all her Church fall from the Faith. To ſay all in a word; no man who makes uſe of her</hi> Roſary, <hi>can be damned.</hi> S. <hi>Dominic</hi> having by this time what he lookt for, bids the People to ſay the <hi>Roſary;</hi> then O Miracle never to be forgotten! at every <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> a Troop of Devils under the figure of burning Coals, breaks out of that Heretics Body: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all out, The Virgin gives them her Bleſſing, and goes her way. The Concluſion and deſign of all this is, all ſorts of People from that time applied themſelves in good earneſt to the uſe of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> and to the worſhip of <hi>Mary.</hi> Chriſt and all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles never thought of making thus the Devils to preach his Goſpel; no more did <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias</hi> employ them ſo, to confirm the Law. It ſeems the <hi>Roſary,</hi> as to its end, hath neither Chriſt, nor <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any true Saint to favor it; and therefore tis no wonder, if it was helped by other waies.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:132423:96"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs all the World was not ſo generally blind and ſottiſh, as not to ſee, that the Devil could tell a ly, and juggle then with S. <hi>Dominic;</hi> and ſo this new ſort of ſervice having no better ground to ſtand upon, then the warranty of the Devil, made ſo little Progreſs in the world, that the ſame ſprite under the Name of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was fain to appear

               <p>The ſecond 5 <hi>Doloroſa,</hi> or full of Grief, are about the Paſſion, as at the laſt farwell, when Chriſt went
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:132423:99"/>to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> At the ſight of the Crown of Thorns: At the hearing of the Hammer beating the Nails up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Chronic Deip. an.</hi> 1360.</note> yet he had the grace to think of theſe Grieſs, whenſoever he paſſed by her Image.</p>
               <p>The laſt five Myſteries, which are called <hi>Glorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> or glorious Joies are 1. When ſhe ſaw her Son ariſing out of his Grave. 2. Going to Heaven. 3. When ſhe at the Pentecoſt received the Holy Ghoſt. 4. When ſhe ſaw her ſelf above waited upon and courted by Chriſt, &amp;c. Now if any third part of theſe fifteen Myſteries, can, as you have Examples for it, ſometimes reſcue a Soul out of Hell; ſometimes bring down the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> from heaven; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make Altars ſpeak out; how ſtrong are the fifteen together?</p>

For as the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors teach us, they ſuffered more then need was; and no uſe was made of their ſufferings, becauſe during the 4000 years to Chriſts Aſcenſion, Heaven, they think, was not open; nor had Chriſt impowered any Man to take ought of this Treſure, in order to any Pardons. The ſecond is, the Paſſion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whoſe Blood they ſay,

The third, all the meritorious Sufferings and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which, as they think

                  </note>, ſhe needed not for her ſelf; and ſo the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to others. This one River may make a Sea. The fourth is, the Sufferings, the Martydoms, and the Penances of all the Saints, ſince the Goſpel, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul, S. Dominic,</hi> and <hi>S. Francis,</hi> and all holy Monks and Eremits, who, tho perhaps not quite ſinleſs, yet had no need to do ſo much (as for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:132423:105"/>
               <p>Here then you have to make uſe of, firſt, all the Blood which the Martyrs from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Barachias,</hi> under the Old, and from him to the laſt Sufferer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament could ſhed, in above five thouſand years. Secondly, We have of Chriſts Blood, all he ever ſhed upon the Croſs, ſaving one drop; all that whole Flood, I ſay, that from his Head down to his Feet guſhed from his Wounds, and the opening of all his Veins, even ſince his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: and by this gueſs, how many thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Roman</hi> Churches may be redeemed with this Treſure, if well applied. Thirdly, You have in the ſame ſtore, the hard Penances, the cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and the voluntary Whippings, whether bloody or unbloody of all other Saints, Monks and Eremits: whatever either <hi>S. Anthony,</hi> or <hi>S. Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> or <hi>S. Paulus,</hi> ſo much celebrated by <hi>S. Jerome:</hi> whatever <hi>S. Zebinas, S. Julian, S. Simeon, S.

For beſides all theſe ſufferings, all the meritorious Works of pious men from the very firſt to the laſt Saint are gathered in; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath found the way of parting a good work in two, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Here are two very great Wonders for Men and Angels to look upon: The firſt, How all this Blood and Sufferings are from the remoteſt parts of the World, and through the diſtance of all Ages fetch'd and gathered into this Treſury. The ſecond, How, when thus got home, the Pope can diſperſe them ſo well abroad.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To get all in, the Blood of Chriſt and his Martyrs cannot be conveied into the <hi>Roman</hi> Treſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as Rivers are down their Chanels into the Sea; or as leſſer Waters are by Pipes and Spouts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied into a Ciſtern: No more alſo can they be kept in Bottles, as they ſay our Ladies Milk is; nor in Ward-robes, or other Rooms, as they ſay alſo her ſhoes and ſhifts are; and by that means it were poſſible to fetch up all from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> or from <hi>Rome,</hi> or from <hi>Venice,</hi> or from any other Country. But as if you ſhould ſee theſe ſaid Bottles, Shifts, Shoes, and other Relics, leave all of them upon their own accord their reſpective uſual Abodes, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:132423:107"/>flock together into one place, you would take it for a ſtrange Miracle, as ſtrange at the leaſt, as when the Chamber where they ſay the Virgin was born, jumped with the Doors, Chimney, Windows and all, from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Lauretta;</hi> the Satisfactions and Scourgings, and other Penances of the Saints, to meet under the hand of his Holineſs, muſt not do leſs. Whether we be bound to imagine ſuch an Attractive Vertu at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Center of their Church, to draw ſatisfactions to her Treſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as there is imagin'd in the Center of the World, to draw heavy Bodies to its bottom; or whether all this be done by ſome other ſtrange Conveiances: however, all the ſatisfactory Works and Penances, let them be what they can, do tend, and unleſs hindered and ſtopt in ſome paſſage, take their courſe towards this Store-houſe. Inſomuch, that

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Wonder is about the getting out what is thus got in, and the ſcattering it far and near upon all manner of Perſons, Families, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other things whatſoever his Holineſs can think upon. Let the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> but turn the Cock, this Fountain will caſt forth its Waters what way, how much, and how far he will; and as he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:132423:107"/>may chuſe what he pleaſes, nothing hinders him to pick out for example the works of <hi>Abel,</hi> that have bin kept cloſe five or ſix thouſand years, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to <hi>Gardiner:</hi> or all the Merits of auſtere <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and beſtow them upon the courſe of ſome wanton Catholic Lady. 'Tis indeed an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Magazine, or Store-houſe, that can keep things ſo long for ſo good ends. And, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great Wonder, what thing ſoever they be clapt to, there they ſhall be as long, or longer, then the very matter which they ſtick to. Let his Holineſs for example, apply one of theſe Bleſſings by way of local Indulgence to an Altar or a Church, it will outlaſt the very Stones (unleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called;) and tho Thunder or time beats them down

               <p>As this Treſure is beſt contrived, both for the Intereſt of Covetous, and the Luſt of lewd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is made up of Blaſphemies, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent lies againſt God. The firſt Pope who invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, maintain'd it upon this ground, That
<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Clemens</hi> 6. <hi>Extravag. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nigenitus.</hi>
                  </note> one drop of Chriſts Blood could ſave man-kind: whence follows, that he had no need to die. Hereupon the Blaſphemer concludes, <hi>That ſince God ſpared not his Son, but put him to ſuch a violent death, as forced out of him not one ſingle drop, but</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>a whole ſtream and Flood of Blood, there muſt be ſomewhere a Treſury to receive this moſt precious, but ſuperfluous quantity, leſt it be loſt.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This impious untruth deſtroies the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts ſatisfaction and ſufferings, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances all what the old, and the new, and worſe <hi>Arrians</hi> will ſay againſt his Sacrifice upon the Croſs. For if one drop of Blood was ſufficient, he ſhed that and more at his Circumciſion, and thus far his Paſſion was uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It charges the Juſtice of God with ſuch a foul Reproch, as can never be waſh'd off, as long as this <hi>Roman Treſury</hi> ſhall ſtand: For ſince it ſtands merely to receive that Blood, which might have bin ſpared at our dear Saviors Paſſion; it ſtands up as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:132423:108"/>an Evidence, that whatſoever is therein kept, was demanded of, and paied by Chriſt, as a tyrannous rigor above what was due, to afflict and torment him; and that the ſame Eternal Judg, who, as they ſay, is ſo merciful, even in Hell, as to take

                     <hi>Aloys. Novarin. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra Virg.

               <p>Thirdly, It throws the ſame Dirt upon that Love, which God bears to his only beloved Son. For Chriſt never ſought for Torments, farther then they were neceſſary for the ſaving of his own Fleſh, that is, Man-kind. Contrariwiſe, with Praiers and Tears he wiſh'd, <hi>That that Cup might paſs from him:</hi> And therefore, what kindneſs had this bin in God the Father, to put his Son to vain Tortures, and to plunge his very Soul into a moſt ſhameful kind of death, when one drop of Blood had done as much, the Popes Intereſt being laid aſide? And what Bowels, and natural Compaſſions were theſe, in both a Juſt and Loving Father, to draw ſo much Blood out of his Son, as ſhould bring him to a cruel Death, merely to fill up <hi>Roman</hi> Purſes?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Nothing leſs then blind Covetouſneſs, could betray Men into that blind Opinion. For what could perſwade the Popes, that one drop of Chriſts Blood was enough to ſave all the World out of Hell, but the pretence of having all the reſt in their diſpoſal, to ſave Men from Purgatory? Can any ordinary Divine, unleſs blinded by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, be ſo fundamentally ignorant, as not to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:132423:109"/>know, that what ſinners deſerve, the Law demands, the Sacrifices for ſin did threaten, and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, or our ſurety for us was to ſuffer, was a real and curſed Death? And can any other then a mad-men think, that a Drop of Blood ſhed without Death is a real and curſed Death? It is true, one Drop of that Blood was of an infinite value: and tis perhaps with this pretenſe, that Popes blind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others, or unconſidering men in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues have talkt unwarily, but there are many more things in Chriſt, which are of an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as for example his Praiers, his Groanings, his Tears, &amp;c. which yet are not ſufficient for our Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; for no infinite thing could be it, but ſuch as were an infinite death: and certanly a Drop of Blood, is neither death, nor a death of infinite worth.</p>

                  </note> have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation to ſet their Church Treſure upon; which I confeſs is not ſo impious as the former; but is as much or more impertinent. They ſay, and they ſay well, that the Death of Jeſus Chriſt was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient, not only to ſave thoſe few, who are ſaved out of the World; but to ſave all men beſides, and twenty thouſand both men and worlds more, if God had created them; and if they had corrupted themſelves. Hereupon, and this is their fooliſh Impertinency, they part Chriſts death and infinite Ranſom into two; Namely that which hath bin really applied and made uſe of; and that which hath not bin ſo. The former, they think well beſtowed on them, who are or ſhall be really ſaved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay no claim to it. But the other, which is the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:132423:109"/>far greater part, that never was applied, becauſe it was rejected; for fear it ſhould fall to the ground, they challenge it for their Treſure; and that is it, which they apply every 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year in a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and every day in Indulgences.</p>
               <p>After this rate <hi>Rome</hi> may provide for new ſtore-houſes; for they may part as well in two, the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom or power or Providence of God; and leaving that part he makes uſe of, for Creating and Ordering this one world, wherein we live; take for themſelves that other ſhare, which might have ſerved, and yet did not, for creating and ordering of thouſand more. Did one ever hear of mad-men, that went about to treſure up that part of ſun-ſhine, that might ſhew the way to a whole Army, when but one man makes uſe of it? or to reſerve that part of Chriſts Voice, as far as it might have bin heard by the ſeventy, where it was heard but by the twelve Diſciples? the Papiſts in this Poin are very little wiſer then ſo. The ſame Wiſdom and Power of God, which is all-ſufficient both to create and order many worlds, is all neceſſary; and therefore indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and wholly ſet to order one: the ſame Sun-ſhine which at one time fills a whole Hemiſphere, or the voice, and Sermon, which fills a great Auditory, do not uſe to ſubdivide themſelves into greater or leſſer ſhares after the number of Eies, or Ears of more or fewer preſent perſons. One Ear hath as much of the voice, (being in a convenient diſtance) as hath the whole Auditory: and one Eie takes as much of the light for its own uſe, as twenty do: and both the voice and the light impart themſelves wholly and indiviſibly, whether to one, or to fourſcore. Much more doth the al-ſufficient ſatisfaction and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:132423:110"/>Ranſom of Chriſt our Savior, which being by it ſelf infinite, muſt needs therefore be indiviſible. For if you part it into ſhares; either theſe ſhares are finite and limited; and ſo they cannot make an Infinite: or if they be infinite and immenſe; then every one of theſe Parcels, muſt be conceived as great as the whole; which is abſurd, contradictory, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And tho this infinite ſatisfaction and Ranſom were ſuch as could be divided; yet every one man hath need of all. As every mans ſin is infinite, that is, deſerves an infinite Puniſhment, ſo muſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for it, be infinite in the ſame way, that is as great as can be preſented to an infinite Majeſty, by an infinitely worthy Savior. By conſequent, the unconceavable Mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and the infinite Price offered to the Divine Juſtice by this Savior, cannot be diſtributed, as the price he was ſold for, in thirty Pieces. Whoſoever applies to himſelf that immenſe value of Chriſts Blood, applies it all: and all being not too much for him; he hath nothing of it to ſpare. This is plain and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to any unconcerned Chriſtian, that hath but learned well his Catechiſm. Now when Popes came with their new and ſtrange <hi>Dividend;</hi> ſo much to God, for them, whom this Blood ſaves: and ſo much, which is twenty thouſand times more to me, from them, whom it doth not; and out of this large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much muſt go for ſo many years of pardon to one, and for ſo many daies to another; they ſo tear the Sacrifice and Body of Chriſt, as the other <hi>Romans</hi> would have torn his Garment; and as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves part and diſtribute their own Relics. Here is an Arm of ſome Saint for his Imperial, and there a skull for his moſt Catholic Majeſty. The moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:132423:110"/>King muſt have ſomething; and the devout and Holy Queen <hi>Christina</hi> likewiſe, a Hand, a Toe, a Tooth, a Jawbone or what you pleaſe. This is the great <hi>Roman</hi> Wiſdom; let the <hi>Jubilee</hi> come when it will; <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall find in this Treſury e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to buy, and <hi>Rome</hi> to ſell. And if Proteſtants offer to ſcruple at this new Divinity; great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars will ſpend all their wit, and the Vatican all its learning and all its Books, to juſtifie what <hi>Bedlam</hi> ſaies.</p>
               <p>The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s and other Saints number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Satisfactions fill up alſo a conſiderable Corner in this Store-houſe: and the ſame Villains, who make God ſo unnatural to his own Son as to make him ſuffer far more grievous Puniſhments, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Juſtice did require; make him in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as bad, and in another reſpect, worſe to his Sons friends; as bad, if he makes them alſo pay more then they owe: and worſe, if he make them pay it for debts, namely for temporal Puniſhments, which the blood of Jeſus Chriſt had moſt ſufficiently paied for already. And the Drift of charging God with this rigor both againſt Chriſt and againſt his Saints in taking of them more then the due, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow this <hi>Overplus,</hi> and <hi>ſuperfluous ſatisfactions</hi> into the <hi>Roman Magazine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then I ſay, if all theſe ſecond Paiments, and Satisfactions of the Saints be conceived neceſſary for the ſatisfying Divine Vengeance; they either wrong the Juſtice of God, or undervalue the Satisfaction of Chriſt; for if they muſt ſatisfy again for a Debt, which Chriſt had already moſt ſufficiently ſatisfied for; this not only wrongs, but deſtroies all the beſt known Rules of Juſtice: or if Juſtice demands yet
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:132423:111"/>any farther ſatisfaction, it preſuppoſes that it was not yet ſufficiently ſatisfied; and this undervalues and maimes in a very great meſure Chriſts infinite ſatisfaction. What the Papiſts have here to ſay, is, 1. That the Satisfaction of Chriſt is infinite, and therefore moſt ſufficient to diſcharge all ſcores what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but that

But now let them give an account, wherefore it is not: and what Power Chriſt ever gave them of reſtraining the true immenſe value of his ſatisfaction and ſacrifice, in ſuch a meſure as may reſerve both for Popes and Maſs Prieſts as much as they can ſell both in Maſſes, and in Indulgences. 2.

As theſe Creatures had all along to their lives end, a very great ſhare in her Favor, can you think they had none at all in her ſatisfactions for their ſins?

<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bovius Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Annal. an.</hi> 1221. <hi>n.</hi> 10.</note> who heard all his Sermons ſo devoutly, and yet continued a Trade that had need of all he could do? Was St. <hi>Bernard</hi> unkind, or St. <hi>Francis</hi> unnatural, that, not to apply to his Nephew all he could ſpare, for preventing all thoſe Torments, which he ſaw did attend him in Hell, becauſe he had left his Convent? and this, not to do the like to his own Father, who certainly could not fare better, tho there had bin no ſin in him, but this of beating St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and turning him naked out of doors for a mad Fool? In all likelihood the <hi>Roman</hi> Caſh is quite emty, if there is nothing elſe to fill it up, then the ſatisfactions of ſuch Saints; and his Holineſs deals not truly in either ſelling or giving away to ſome, that which the Saints have beſtowed on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the like, or rather a greater folly, to think as
<note n="o" place="bottom">Vid. ſupra.</note> they do, to ſcrape off from every good Work don by the Saints, the labor and pains they took in doing it; and ſo, to think of filling their ſtore with ſuch ſcrapings, inſtead of good ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For firſt, not to ſcruple at their Language, that which is Meritorious, and that which is Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in a good Work, are commonly ſo cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that it is impoſſible to part them aſunder otherwiſe then you may part one and the ſelf-ſame thing, in ſome conſiderations and reſpects. Thus the ſame gallant Action in an Officer for example,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:132423:113"/>who was caſhiered for ſome miſ-behavior, will be ſatisfactory in reſpect of his former Guilt, for the procuring of his Pardon; and in another who is guiltleſs, it will be Meritorious by way of Service only, and 'twill procure him not a Pardon, which he needs not, but it may be, ſome conſiderable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. And if the Service of the Guilty be much greater then his Offence was, and ſuch it may be, <hi>Abners</hi> caſe was, when being in a Rebellion before, he brought the ten Tribes to the King; the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of this ſatisfaction, ſhall be allowed by <hi>David</hi> to be thus far Meritorious, and thus far alſo to have a Reward. After this rate, no part of the gallant Service ſhall remain behind for the Treſury, but the whole ſhall be taken up and accepted for its full worth, tho partially, ſo much to procure his Pardon by a Commutative; and ſo much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him another Reward, by a diſtributive Juſtice. A good King, I ſay, will obſerve theſe Proportions with his Subjects: and I hope, at the laſt Day, God will not deal worſe with his Children. 2. When it happens, as it doth ſometimes, that the labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painful part is ſo extrinſecal to the good work, as to be eaſily ſevered from it; as when <hi>S. Paul</hi> Preaches in the Chain, or when <hi>S. John</hi> looſes his Head in a Priſon for his Preaching; altho the Chain and the Preaching be two different things in their nature, yet they cohere and are cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Eies of God Almighty: there the holy Work of Preaching ſhall ſanctifie the cruel Chain; &amp; the hard Chain ſhall improve the price of the Holy or Meritorious Preaching. And if <hi>David</hi> can well conſider not only what Service <hi>Abner</hi> did him, in bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> to him; but alſo, that he loſt an
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:132423:114"/>Army, or part of his Eſtate in doing it; there is no fear, but God is a good God, and will extend his Mercies as far, both on what his Servants do in his Name, and what they ſuffer in thoſe Services: <hi>For I ſay unto you, that every one that hath forſaken Houſes, or Children, or Lands, &amp;c. ſhall receive an hundred fold more, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 19. And when every little parcel of the Suffering is recompenſed, as well as the Meritorious part, with ſo liberal a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; What can Popes ſcrape off from it, that remains unrewarded, to ſpend in ſatisfactions for more, and to lay up in their Treſury? It ſeems theſe crafty Shavers would have the Meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for one thing, and the pain of performing it for another: or in more homely terms, they would give the Money for the Purchaſe, and the trouble of telling and paying it, for the diſcharge of ſome other Debts; whereas the ſum well told and paid, can ſcarce ſuffice to buy the firſt, much leſs to leave any over-plus to ſatisfie the ſecond Account. 3. Laſtly, Whenever Croſſes and Hardſhips fall upon one, not in order to any good Work which they do precede or follow, but becauſe they are ſent from God, for Chaſtiſements, or Curbs, or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; as the Tribulations of <hi>Job,</hi> the buffeting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Sicklineſs of <hi>Timotheus</hi> were: or becauſe they are voluntarily fetch'd in, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by ſome Saints; as the hard Diet of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> the often Faſtings of <hi>Anna,</hi> the low and narrow Lodge of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> the ſeeming barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mortifications of ſome ancient Holy Perſons: What is all this to the Popes Treſure? Did ever God at any time lay theſe Afflictions on the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in order to make the Pope richer, or his own
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:132423:114"/>Children humble and better? And when theſe laied them on themſelves, can the <hi>Roman</hi> Church well think, but that they intended them rather for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their own Bodies, and ſecuring their own Salvation, then for diſcharging other Mens ſins? What and if God and they laied more then was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for theſe true ends, Are <hi>Roman</hi> Divines igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that God, who made <hi>Job</hi> twice as rich as he was before he made him poor, will moſt abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remunerate all ſuch hard ſurpluſage, if there is any? And when all accounts are made even, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Burthens are charged either by their Savior, or themſelves; St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, <hi>That the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent life</hi> (and 'tis with theſe, if ſome could be found unrewarded, that this Treſury ſhould be ſtuffed up) are ſo far from ſuperabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or equalling, <hi>that they are not to be compared with that Glory</hi> (immenſe reward of all Sufferings, and not only of all good Works) <hi>which ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled in us,</hi> Ro. 8.18. Or if by chance <hi>Clement</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the firſt Founder of this Treſure, better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this Balance, and ſaw in ſome corner or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about S. <hi>Mary,</hi> S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and other Martyrs, ſome unrewarded Afflictions which S. <hi>Paul</hi> took no notice of; in Conſcience are we come to this, that <hi>Roman</hi> Popes may fetch them out, and apply them to whom they pleaſe? That poor <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſhall ſee from Heaven his auſtere Life and hairy Clothes, ſhelter <hi>Herods</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> lying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely together?

                  <hi>Concerning</hi> Roman <hi>Indulgences, the moſt general Inducement to Popery.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Church <hi>Treſury,</hi> the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> are words capable of a good ſenſe, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would allow of it. For really, the Church of God poſſeſſes a very great Treſure, namely, Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, and in his Holy Ordinances. All ſinners, whoſoever they be, if <hi>contriti &amp; confeſſi</hi> after Gods way, that is, really and truly penitent, and turning from their ſins to good Works, ſuch as become true Chriſtian Faith and Repentance, may without the Keies of the Pope open this Heavenly Treſure, and thence take out as much of Chriſts Blood, or, to make uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> terms, as much of the ſatisfactions of Chriſt, as will make up a full and a moſt plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; that is, Mercy and Pardon without Mony, and plenteous Redemtion both from the Spot and the puniſhment of all their Sins. <hi>John the Baptist,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:132423:115"/>Jeſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, are the firſt Men, who at the very Birth of the Chriſtian Church did Preach abroad theſe Indulgences: and among them <hi>Peter</hi> is the firſt (not <hi>Boniface</hi>) who proclamed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the great Chriſtian Jubilee. You have his Bull in his Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for her own ends, hath much abuſed this good Treſure, as well as theſe great Indulgences: and if you look into what ſhe hath to brag of, you ſhall find her Treſury to be but a broken Ciſtern, and her Indulging Bulls, inſtead of Living Waters, to be but Puddles. With all the Blood ſhed on the Croſs, one drop whereof in their judgement could have ſaved all, they ſay that Chriſt hath not fully ſatisfied for any actual ſins after our Baptiſm; and that beſides the Eternal Torments in Hell, for which he hath immediatly ſatisfied, there remain other not leſs grievous, tho not ſo long, for which we our ſelves muſt needs ſatisfie, either in this Life, or near about Hell, in a place under Ground which they call Purgatory. Their Maſs Prieſts and Biſhops, with all their ordinary Power, cannot abſolve their Penitents, tho never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, farther then this: and to have more, they muſt either procure it to themſelves, by their own works, or ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for Indulgences.</p>
               <p>All this is pack'd and contrived with great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the beſt advantage of <hi>Rome.</hi> His Holineſs gains much by it, for all that Blood which might have paid for all the pains, as well as for the vicious Acts of ſin, is ſpared for his Treſury: and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Souls being affrighted with Purgatory, out of which Chriſt hath not redeemed them, and which none but Saints or Martyrs are likely to eſcape;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:132423:116"/>there is no fear he can want Money, as long as he will help Men out with his Treſure and Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The other inferior Clergy alſo are not looſers, for tho their Power be much ſhortned from giving full Abſolution, this Reſtraint may be look'd upon as a rule of good Husbandry; for if they did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all at once by their Keies, as God doth by his Miniſters in his Goſpel, who, unleſs ſome ſimple Ignorant, would care for any of their Maſſes? But both Chriſt, and all Chriſtian Souls ſuffer much, by what others gain. Chriſt is viſibly defrauded of the Honor that he ever had of being the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, which he is not at the leaſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi> but in a large fenſe; ſince both others and we, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well redeem our ſelves, and ſatisfie Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in a very conſiderable meſure by our own perſonal Sufferings. Chriſt alſo ſuffers a ſecond and groſs Injury, to ſee the moſt part of his Blood under the indiſcreet hand of a Pope, who ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it at their pleaſure who will buy out his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. Chriſtian Souls are not uſed better, being by theſe Indulgences drawn aſide from the true waies of Salvation, to ſpend their Devotion and their Mony upon that which avails nothing; and which, if relied upon, will certainly prove a great deal worſe in the event.</p>
               <p>The main ground of all theſe Deviſes, is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Blaſphemies, and an open Profeſſion, that Chriſt hath not by his Sacrifice on the Croſs, fully ſatisfied Divine Juſtice; or that God demands from Penitents and Believers, that which he was ſatisfied for; and that our ſins are neither fully nor properly remitted in the Blood of Chriſt. Theſe three Antichriſtian Aſſertions, being involved and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:132423:116"/>wrapt up in this, which both their Purgatory, and all their Indulgences ſtand upon, that God in Chriſt remits the ſins, without remitting the puniſhment; that is, that God in Chriſt remits our ſins without remitting them at all. For if God in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſins, why, being fully and properly remitted, are they (unleſs redeemed by Indulgences) puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Purgatory? How comes God to demand of his Children that they be burned and tormented in order to ſatisfie his Juſtice, if the Sacrifice of his Son hath ſatisfied it fully and properly on that account? And what Juſtice is this to exact of me the ſame ſatisfaction and payment, that Chriſt my Surety hath fully given already? They ſay that Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for our ſins, but not for that part of the puniſhment, which either Purgatory doth inflict, or the Popes Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences muſt diſpenſe with. Againſt this, it is eaſie to prove, and common ſenſe will tell them ſo, that both Chriſt hath ſatisfied Juſtice on all accounts, and God remitted ſins likewiſe as to the ſatisfying of Juſtice, if Juſtice have in Chriſts Sufferings all it requires from guilty Perſons, upon the ſcore of ſuffering. For what is it, that Divine Juſtice can demand of the worſt and guiltieſt ſinner? Is it that the ſins which he hath committed, may never have bin committed? that is impoſſible, &amp; a plain contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and if God remits ſins upon ſuch terms, he remits none. Is it that the ſinner may not ſin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? So much did Juſtice demand of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; and ſo much demands it yet of the bleſſed Angels, to whom nevertheleſs God remits or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives nothing, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was not yet, and theſe are never Treſpaſſers. The Queſtion is, What it is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:132423:117"/>which the ſevere and holy Juſtice of God can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Treſpaſſers? Sin, as to this, denotes two things, to wit, the Vice or Illneſs of the Act, and the puniſhment due by the treſpaſs for that ill Act. Divine Juſtice requires not the ill Act, or the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it; contrariwiſe, it ſhuns, deteſts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it: What therefore Juſtice doth and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is all due, and ſufficient puniſhment. Now pardoning, or forgiving, or remitting, is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or to forgive, or to remit, what Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the ſinner and for his ſin, and this is the puniſhment only. And ſo when Chriſt did on the Croſs ſatisfie Juſtice for our ſins, and did take our ſins from us upon himſelf, it was not by taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our Vices, or ugly Acts and Diſpoſitions, God forbid! Chriſt took all our ſins upon himſelf, when he took and paied fully all the puniſhment due for our ſins: and God remits and forgives our ſins in Chriſt, when he accepts of that puniſhment of his in lieu of ours. Therefore whenſoever Papiſts talk of ſins remitted, as to the treſpaſs of the Fault, &amp; not as to the puniſhments due for the fault; or that Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied for thoſe &amp; not fortheſe, it is either ſuch a piece of non-ſenſe, as if one ſhould ſay, That he forgives me all my Debts, on condition I ſhall pay them: or a Blaſphemous Raillery put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, as if he did fully ſatisfie Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for all our ſins, when, except thoſe before Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, he ſatisfies ſo for none of them. And ſo the whole Frame of Purgatory for puniſhing, and all the Jubilees, and Indulgences, and daily Maſſes, for abſolving Men from the puniſhment of remitted ſins, that is, the whole Fabric of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is built upon theſe impious Bulls.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:132423:117"/>
               <p>It is true, God may, and often doth lay heavy Chaſtiſements (call them Puniſhments if you pleaſe) on his Children, even after he hath pardoned their ſins, but it is never to ſatisfy Divine Juſtice in any puniſhment it requires more; but either to keep the forgiven ſinner, by what he feels, from ſinning more; or to affright others from it by ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; or for removing the ſcandal, which otherwiſe might well ariſe from all unchaſtiſed ſins. Which conſiderations agree not at all with the Torments of Purgatory, where Souls,

                  </note> as they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are neither better in themſelves, nor either more exemplary, or a whit leſs ſcandalous to others by what they ſuffer. There theſe poor Souls burn and howl in long and terrible torments, with the Faith of Chriſt above them, and the Blood of his Sacrifice upon their pretended remitted ſins, juſt as notable Rogues are hanged and quartered ſomtimes with their Pardons about their Necks. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would be much diſpleaſed to hear that any of their devout and contrite Dames ſhould ſuffer ſo much in ſpight of one plenary Indulgence; and Chriſt muſt not be ſo, to ſee his true and lively Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers tortured in Purgatory in ſpight of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Indulgences were never heard of, till the ſilly World had bin frighted with theſe Flames of Purgatory, which as their moſt ingenious Authors confeſs, was very late: and then the Roman Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had a fair opportunity from the falſe Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Souls, and tremblings of ſimple People, to look to their own private profits, by ſelling vain Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities to protect againſt vain dangers &amp; fears. The
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:132423:118"/>very ſound of a Latin word, <hi>Indulgentia,</hi> without its proper ſenſe and uſe, was ground enough for crafty men, to build what they would upon it; and how far they have abuſed it, and more abuſed their Church with it, one may gueſs by what here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>It was, and ſhould be ſtill, the Practiſe of the Holy Church, to expell from their Society Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and known ſinners: and ſince the Church could not alwaies keep Hypocrites from coming in; ſhe could not take a better courſe for aſſerting both her deteſtation againſt all ſin, and her credit with God and men, then to keep them off, when duly known; and to ſhun them, in their holy Meetings eſpecially, till many and great Evidences both of their ſorrow for what they had done, and of their Amendment for the time to come, had procured them Readmittance. They were

Theſe long and holy Exerciſes did paſs among all Chriſtians for Satisfactions to the Church; and in ſome manner

Before the Church moſt properly; becauſe that was all which the Church Diſcipline, and Eccleſiaſtical Canons did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and before God in a lower, yet a very true and proper ſenſe; becauſe, tho all ſuch works of Repentance be far from being a price equivalent to what Divine Juſtice demands (which can never be had, but either from the eternal death of the ſinner, or from the infinite ſatisfactions of Chriſt for him)
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:132423:118"/>yet it is the main Condition, which God requires of Offenders, before the grant of his Pardon, and which he is in his Mercy both ſatisfied and pleaſed with, when they ſincerely perform it.</p>
               <p>This was not all, 'twas not enough to have don it, they muſt do it a long

By this, it ſeems, the holy Fathers had a great care, that in the management of their keies, whether to ſhut out, or to let in, their Church might keep time with Heaven: ſo that they might neither retein, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit here upon Earth, but what and when they might well judg, God would retein, or remit above. It was not then, as now at <hi>Rome,</hi> where Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Licences are preſently got at a ſmall Rate; a Raviſher of a Virgin was in the year 1520 (I hear it is now much raiſed, as well as the Rate of Monies) about ſix

So
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:132423:119"/>careful were they in thoſe daies to clear the Church from foul Scandals: and ſo afraid were they withal in the exerciſe of their Power, to break correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with Gods Juſtice; to unlooſe them whom he kept bound; and to bind themſelves before God,

               <p>Nevertheleſs there now and then happened ſuch cauſes as not only permitted, but moved them alſo to be more free. As when the excommunicated Sinner gave ſignal proofs of an extraordinary ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: when upon dangerous occaſions he ſtoutly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended the Chriſtian Faith: when in times of Perſecutions all Chriſtians were to be encouraged, and ſtrengthened to Martyrdom: and when valiant Confeſſors (who ever before their Death, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for true Martyrs) did intercede for ſome of their friends; on theſe and other like rational and pious Inducements, the holy Fathers thought they might,

And this Relaxation of Eccleſiaſtical Severity, ſome Latin Fathers
<note n="e" place="bottom">Cyprian. de Lapſis Sub ſin. Tertull. de Exhortat. Caſtit.</note> call once or twice in their writings, by the Name of Indulgence.</p>
               <p>Tbis was enough for cunning Cheats, to ground
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:132423:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>their Indulgences upon; and for ſilly men, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. So that as one word <hi>Miſſa</hi> could ſerve their turn, as I have ſhew'd in another Book, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing that great Abomination, which they call Maſs: ſo doth this other Latin word <hi>Indulgentia,</hi> uſed once or twice by ſome ancient Authors in a good ſenſe, and now turned to a quite other; for countenancing all the Impoſtures, that now a daies are bought and ſold under the name of Indulgences. Here you may whenſoever you pleaſe, diſcover <hi>Romes</hi> either Knavery, or Folly, or both by theſe two diſtinct Characters. The firſt is, that when the Fathers thought good to uſe any Indulgence, it was to ſhorten, or to moderate their Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>before Reconciliation and pardon:</hi> whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgence is for another ſort of Puniſhments, which Maſs Prieſt are pleaſed both to inflict on the Penitents, and to moderate or quite take off after their Abſolution. The ſecond is, that the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers never either thought, or attemted to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or to take off any other Cenſures or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then ſuch as had bin impoſed: whereas the Pope by his Indulgences offers to moderate or take off all, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what is laid on by his Church, and what is or ſhall be laid on by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Mark, to diſtinguiſh the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Relaxations, from the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; The Church of Chriſt never uſed upon any occaſion whatſoever, this unnatural and popiſh way of inflicting puniſhments or Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, after Pardon: and therefore they could not have occaſion of ever granting ſuch Indulgences, as ſhould eaſe men after pardon, from ſuch Cenſures. When notorious and public Offences had turned the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:132423:120"/>ſinner out of dores; the Holy Fathers did lay on him ſeveral Degrees of Rigor, before they would take him in again, as antecedent Preparations to make him fit to be taken in. 1. The Sinner was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<note n="a" place="bottom">Greg. Neocaeſar. Epiſt. Canon.</note> to ſtand without; and there with cries and tears
<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ambroſius. De Paenit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> to beg them who came in, to pray to God for him. 2. Some years or months after, he was admitted within Doors, but in a remote Corner of the Church, behind the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> that is, the not Chriſtened <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> where they might hear Sermons, but not Praiers. 3. After ſuch other time as they thought fit; he was ſuffered to hear and pray with the Chriſtians, but not to take the Holy Myſteries. Theſe with ſome other Mortifications and trials were all the Penalties inflicted by the Church upon ſcandalous Offenders; the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when undergon, given by the Offenders to the Church; and when humbly and ſincerely perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon good grounds were alſo thought in the ſenſe above ſaid, acceptable to God himſelf. And here among theſe performances was the only time of Indulgence, either to ſhorten the time, or to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Rigor of the Hardſhip, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 4. This don, either with, or without favor; at laſt the ſinner was at the time appointed for his Readmiſſion, brought in into the Church; there he kneeled, and there the Biſhop coming to him, as the good Father in the Goſpel to the loſt Child, fell both himſelf and all the People upon their knees: then after holy Praiers and a holy laying on of hands, gave him Sacerdotal Bleſſing, and complete Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: raiſed him up from kneeling: for concluſion
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:132423:120"/>of all, he was admitted at the ſame time, both to the holy Communion, and the Churches Peace. The Penitents being thus reconcil'd neither under-went other Puniſhments, nor needed other Indulgences. And if that Holy Mother the Primitive Church uſed to chaſtiſe her ſtubborn Children, and upon their amendment to kiſs and embrace them afterwards; we do not read in any Father, that it was ever her Method, firſt to kiſs, then to correct and puniſh. It is an extravagance proper to <hi>Rome,</hi> to abſolve her Penitents and after Abſolution, to have them pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht thereby to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are all her Indulgences, to eaſe men of ſuch Puniſhments, Tricks of their own invention. Our Savior did not plague ſinners, after he had bid them, <hi>go in Peace:</hi> and if God kept them afterwards hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſenſible of their former ſins by Fatherly Corrections, as you read often that he did; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences are but both idle and ſawcy Toies to take them off. And this brings to the ſecond viſible Character, by which you may diſcern the Primitve Relaxations, from the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore as to this ſecond; the Fathers of the Primitive Church never intended with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions or favors to moderate or to take off any other Puniſhments, then that which they had laid on by their own ſentence and Cenſure: They knew that the Power of reteining, and the Power of remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which God allowed them in his Church, are both

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:132423:121"/>very Contents, and Form of their Warrant, <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall bind on Earth, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 1.16.19. and 18.18. and <hi>John</hi> 20.23. Where the power of Looſing and Remitting, follows cloſe to that of Retaining and Binding. This is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by Excommunications and Cenſures, that, by taking them away in the reconciling of Offenders; and both Keies turn in the ſame wards, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame compaſs, within the Miniſterial Pale of the Church, and within the bounds of this Life. <hi>Roman</hi> Popes are the firſt Hectors, who durſt break out beyond theſe Lines, and roving into Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there over-rule Divine Juſtice, and pull out thence out of Gods hands the Souls, whom, they ſay, his Vengeance doth burn and torment. This is then the drift of the Popes, and the ſecond viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mark of their beſt and moſt authentic Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; that whereas the Fathers of the Church never attemted to diſpoſe of any other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then ſuch as they had inflicted: the Popes ſtretch their hands much farther, even as far as to reverſe the Judgments, which, (as they preſuppoſe it) God inflicts. Now let <hi>Rome</hi> ranſack their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and procure from any corner of good and known Antiquity, one precedent for ſuch Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
               <p>In the mean while laying aſide Antiquity, which in true Conſcience cannot but ſhame this new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt; it is a buſineſs worth enquiring, what theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences (whether new or old) are in themſelves. They are intended for theſe
<note n="c" place="bottom">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:132423:121"/>Abſolution here in the Church. 2. And the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of more grievous puniſhments, laied on them by God Almighty, yonder in Purgatory. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is hard to ſay, in the which of theſe two you ſhall find leſs, both Impiety and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Indulgences for the firſt end, are both fooliſh and impious upon ſeveral accounts: What rebellious attemt is this, to bind to puniſhment thoſe (Men, as it is ſuppoſed, contrite and truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for their ſins) whom the Goſpel of Chriſt looſes and abſolves? May not one as well curſe, whom God bleſſes, as retain or bind whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits? And if one may bind the Penitents, whom God abſolves; may he not as well unbind the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Impenitents whom God hath bound? If ſo, we know where the Antichriſt lies; yet he ſhould go and learn Manners from the Example of <hi>Balaam, Num.</hi> 23.8. They ſay, that what they bind their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents to, is not a Puniſhment only, but an uſeful Correction alſo. Then, I ſay, what they do in binding them whom God doth looſe, ſhall be as far a Rebellion, as it is a puniſhment; and as far unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unchriſtian to take off, as 'tis an uſeful Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and as it was good to lay it on. And have the Popes no better waies to fill their Coffers, and to maintain their Holineſſes, then by ſuch a Trade of Indulgences, as diſpenſe with Men againſt their own good? 2. There is yet more; to juſtifie their Penalties from being a reſiſting of God, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he remits; they ſay, that after Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution they lay no more on any Man, then what a ſincere Penitent <hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>is both willing to undergo, and obliged by the fear of God, and the ſenſe of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:132423:122"/>to do or ſuffer;</hi> and that this is it properly and directly, what the Indulgences do eaſe Men from. Do not then call this, if you pleaſe, Rebellion or Reſiſting God: but you cannot chooſe but perceive, that if this ſame penitent Soul lies not between a cruel binding Confeſſor, and a gracious remitting God; ſhe now falls into another as bad or worſe condition. For here is within the ſenſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that charges her to do or ſuffer ſuch a thing; and there is without, a Bull from <hi>Rome,</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges her from both doing and ſuffering it: Do you not think to ſee this Soul, as the Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> was once, between a good and a bad Angel? Here God impreſſes a pious Fear, in order that the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may do ot ſuffer ſuch a thing; and there the Pope ſhews an Indulgence, that he may do but what he pleaſes: Do you not ſee God, and the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting ſtill about <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; ſtrugling one againſt the other, what way ſhall be taken by this honeſt Soul? If the Pope have the better of it, then his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences come to this, and the Satisfactions and Blood of Chriſt, which the Pope wraps up in theſe Bulls, have this good end, namely, that Men need not be perplexed for Gods Fear, nor for the motions of Conſcience. Certainly, not to do what both the fear of God, and the ſenſe of an honeſt Conſcience do move us to, is a fearful omiſſion: and if any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence can waſh it off, it muſt exemt Men not only from a puniſhment, as they pretend, but from a very great ſin alſo, which they do not. 3. This ſcattering and abuſing the Blood of Chriſt by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, will better appear, if you conſider in retail what theſe Penalties are, which this Blood applied to us by them, muſt free us from. Theſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:132423:122"/>Penalties are chiefly theſe three,

                  <hi>Pagans</hi> can tell you, that the exerciſe of Moral Vertues is even a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Happineſs: How then come good Catholics to imagine, that the exerciſe of Chriſtian ones may be to them a puniſhment? In conſcience, is Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Faſting, and giving of Alms, the puniſhment, or part of it, which ſin deſerves? Did ever Gods Law reckon Praier and Charity amongſt its Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Or did ever the Goſpel of Chriſt impoſe this Holy and Bleſſed Exerciſe, under the notion of Chaſtening? Is it likely, that the Apoſtles, who often plagued Men with Blindneſs, with Death, with delivering them over to Satan, ever inflicted Praiers, and Exerciſes of Alms-giving, as ſtrokes of their Apoſtolical Rod? Did the Lord Jeſus ſhed his Blood to be applied in Indulgences, that you ſhould not Pray, or Faſt at all? Or that we ſhould not Pray, or Faſt ſo much? And if this be none of the true ends of Chriſts Death and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; I do not ſay, how unprofitable, but how both unchriſtian and Antichriſtian are the Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that trifle away this Sacred Blood to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary purpoſes? 4. Laſtly, to lay this impious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe aſide, and to let Faſting, Praying, and charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able giving of Alms, paſs at <hi>Rome</hi> for hard and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhments; yet they are, neither the Death that the Law threatens ſinners with, nor the Helliſh burning in Purgatory, which, as they ſay, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God requires, that they ſhould ſuffer when they are dead: they can be at the moſt, but an emty ſhadow of theſe pains. And tho they were (what
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:132423:123"/>they are not) a full Equivalent for them; yet are they no ſatisfaction in any Balance of Juſtice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God will accept of them for due paiment. Therefore let <hi>Roman</hi> Confeſſors ſhew now to their poor Penitents, either when, and where God hath told them, that he will accept of their Praiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſtead of Purgatory Burnings, which is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per puniſhment: and let the other greater Cheats, the Popes and Bull-ſellers of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſure any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but Fools, upon any probable ground, that God is both pleaſed and reſolved to accept of their Indulgences, in lieu of Faſtings and Praiers, and good and Chriſtian giving of Alms.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond end, that <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences are intended, and ſo bought for, is the removing of that Judgment, which condemns <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics after this Life to dreadful Burnings and Tortures, unleſs (which few beſides Saints and Martyrs can do) they can ſatisfie otherwiſe. This hot and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Torment is not impoſed on departing Souls by Popes or Prieſts; for if it were, it would be no wonder that Popes and Prieſts could remove it. It is none of thoſe voluntary Chaſtiſements, which one may take upon himſelf to prepare him for Gods Mercies, ſince it is confeſſed by them all, that no Body grows better for them. It is an unavoidable Puniſhment lying on them for the ſatisfaction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. It is, they ſay, decreed by God

                     <hi>Navar. de Jubil. Notabil.</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 11.</note> himſelf due and demanded by Gods Law, grounded and radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the eſſential right of Nature: and by this you may judg how indiſpenſable this Purgatory puniſhment is, ſince, as they ſay, God Almighty will rather ſee his own Children burning many
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:132423:123"/>hundreds of years in helliſh Flames, when even their ſins are pardoned, then to break his Law to take it off. Yet the Almighty Pope dares do it: and if you cannot go ſo far as to <hi>Rome, Rome</hi> will in a manner come to you; and give you ſuch an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that is in their own language, ſuch a juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abſolution, as ſhall reverſe all Judgments whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of natural Juſtice, or God himſelf: and thus get you clear on all hands. Heaven and Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford the like Example. A Hoſtler, or a Porter making Acts of Oblivion; or a Priſoner at New-Gate granting Decrees to ſtop the Judges, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> are nothing to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, nor to <hi>Alexander</hi> the fixt, nor to any of thoſe Villains, who ſend Indulgences from <hi>Rome,</hi> and from the Embraces of their Harlots, to obſtruct the Courſe of Divine Juſtice, and to order judicially, to what degrees of Puniſhment it may proceed; or whether it ſhall proceed at all. This is far worſe then what they ſay the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> do, when upon the breaſt
<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wolfius Cent.</hi> 16. <hi>an.</hi> 1580.</note> of their dead Friends, they ſend a Mandat to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> charging him, that at the ſame moment, when he ſhall have received their letter, he fail not to admit the Bearer thereof, whom they have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from all ſins. For the Popes Indulgence is a formal Sentence, and as they call it, a Juridical Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution directed to and ſerved upon God himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the uſual courſe, as they conceive, of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Supreme Juſtice.</p>
               <p>I have read of a conceited man, who, even to the endangering of his life, keeping himſelf from making water, for fear of drowning the whole World, at laſt was perſwaded, it would not be ſo, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:132423:124"/>of his weakneſs upon a poor ſmall Cottage, ſet on fire, which his friends had called him to quench. If His Holineſs in this reſpect were not twenty times more incurable; twenty thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of the like nature might have cured him. Let him and all Papiſts but conſider, what a moſt plenary Indulgence, or even a whole <hi>Jubilee</hi> can do towards the preventing of the leaſt other temporal puniſhment for ſin, for example, want, ſickneſs, or death; and thence let them gueſs, what it can do againſt the greateſt, and, as they conceive the moſt fatal, the burning of Souls after Pardon. Let them try, what kind of Relief theſe Bulls can afford to contrite and repenting Robbers againſt hanging, in an human Judicature; and then hope or deſpair of what they are boaſted to do, againſt the Soveraign Divine Juſtice.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg alſo, that, <hi>the Pope by his Indulgences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pardon any Puniſhment, which is inflicted by God as Judg, in an Exterior and criminal Judicature.</hi> If ſo, in good earneſt doth not God Almighty act as a Judg, when he condemns men to Puniſhment in order to ſatisfy his Juſtice? And is not that an exterior and Criminal Court of Juſtice, whereſoever men are condemned to ſuch grievous and long, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:132423:124"/>Puniſhments? Or if you call it inward; why ſhould the Judgment of God be leſs, and the Power of the Pope more regarded, in Gods own internal, then in his external Judicature?</p>
               <p>Here the Popes are pleaſed to juggle, as the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low uſed to do, who bragged, how far he could jump at Rhodes, where he knew no man had ſeen him. But ſaies one, if it be ſo; come friend, here is as good ground as at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> let us therefore ſee what you can do. The Popes brag much, how bravely they can ſave men from all the dangers in a Place, where no body tells us the truth of what they are pleaſed to brag of. But here in the Courſe of this mortal life, where we ſee ſo many temporal Judgments of God, ſo many Plagues and Penalties inflicted by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty upon abſolved ſinners for their ſins, my <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Boaſter cannot jump: the Popes Bulls ſave from none of them: and by their own Confeſſion, their Indulgences
<note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellar. de Indulg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> can help no man againſt any kind of Miſeries, whether for Original ſins ſuch as are Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, Diſeaſes and Death; or for any actual ſins, ſuch as Plagues upon men, and Countries. It is in vain, when men go to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Bull againſt any kind of Tribulations whatſoever, either in their Soul, or Body, Relations or Fortune. No Indulgence can reprive from any Puniſhments that we can ſee: only that one which we ſee not, the being torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Purgatory for ſins which God hath forgiven; and there only my Jumpers can work wonders, and their Indulgences are worth Gold.</p>
               <p>If the compaſſing of theſe two Ends, namely the eaſing you from pious Exerciſes, whenſoever you are troubled with them; and the removing of Gods
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:132423:125"/>purgatory Juſtice, be both impious and impoſſible; the manner of attemting it by laying out the blood of Chriſt in Indulgences, is not much better. At firſt, when the <hi>Fathers of Trent</hi> talk magnificently of opening their great
<note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Concil. Trident. Seſſ.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Celeſtial Magazines,</hi> and of drawing out thence, by the means of their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Chriſts Blood, and all ſorts of Bleſſings; all this makes ſhew of a great matter. But if you will come but ſomewhat near, you ſhall find it what <hi>Eneas</hi> did, when being in the Heatheniſh <hi>Limbus,</hi> he thought to ſee and embrace his Father; it is but an emty Phantome, which hath neither fleſh nor bones, that you can hold. 1. For firſt this <hi>Celestial Magazine</hi> is not lockt and opened at <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Vatican Library is, whence the Pope and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may lend to <hi>Baronius</hi> what Ancient Records he calls for, there to find tales for his purpoſe; and ſometimes Truth againſt himſelf. Nor is it like the Treſury where His Holineſs keeps his Monies, when it comes in from ſelling Bulls, under the pretenſe of Holy Wars, &amp;c. and goes out as they
<note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Aventin. Annal.

It were fair, if this Treſury, where Chriſts Blood and Ranſom is kept, were but like their Holy Maſs Pyx; where the whole Body lies ſtill at hand, for any man that may want it; for then it were eaſy for the Pope, to take in and out what he pleaſes. They ſay that this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:132423:125"/>whole Treſure is laid up <hi>in mente &amp; acceptatione Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina,</hi>

The Caſe is this. The Pope muſt have to diſpoſe of, as much, or as little of the blood of Chriſt, as he intends to make his Indulgence to be worth. If it be an Indulgence for 40 daies, any Biſhop may take as much; ſo very little of this blood may ſerve: if the Indulgence be for 40, or for 4, or 500 years, he muſt proportionably take ſo much the more; for all Indulgences being ſuppoſed to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fraught with Chriſts Blood; and to be effective Paiments made by the Pope, to God himſelf, out of his Sons ſatisfactions and Sufferings; here firſt you muſt admit another ſuch buſineſs as in the Maſs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Firſt the Pope reaches to part of this Celeſtial Treſure, which is with God (above any human reach one ſhould think) otherwiſe how could he pay it, and having it (I leave to others to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what way the Pope can come it) ſupply all Exigencies, eſpecially at the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and generally at any time. I ask any Chriſtian Conſcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſatisfactions and this Blood, ſuppoſing true what they fancy, ſhould not be much better left in the hand of Chriſt himſelf; then in the diſpoſal of a Pope, who, when we may have the greateſt need, namely when after Death we muſt all ſtand above at the Bar, is at a great diſtance from us; knows neither our Danger, nor our ſins: nor what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall paſs on us; nor what we want to ſecure againſt that danger. Were not this better in his hand, who hath ſhed it, and preſented it already to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:132423:126"/>God, who ſees our need, and who ſtands there to help out? Were it not better left in Gods own hand to whom Chriſt firſt preſented it? And who is the Judg to whom, they ſay, the Pope muſt preſent it back again? Is the Pope being at <hi>Rome</hi> more willing or more able, having this Blood under his key, to help with it remote and unknown Souls, then Chriſt who is preſent, to ſave his Members? And whether of the two is more merciful and more likely to uſe it beſt to our Salvation, the Pope at a diſtance, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to ſtrangers, or God the Father being there preſent, in applying it to his Children? Is it that Chriſts Redemtion muſt come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there be ratified by ſome Bull, before it be good againſt Burning? Secondly, this Paiment, however reacht to, is, they ſay, preſented to God by the Pope. It is ſo in all Indulgences, but in thoſe eſpecially, which his Holineſs grants for the dead. For there the Pope reſcues no man from what he ſuffers, but by offering as much to God, of Chriſts Sufferings, that ſo Juſtice, they ſay,
<note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellarmin. de Indulg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>ſect. Tertia Quaeſtio.</hi>
                  </note> may be ſatisfied by the exchange. And herein lies a moſt impious Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. 1. For what is this, to offer up again what Chriſt, by his eternal Spirit offered before? Was not Chriſts once offering it, ſufficient? Is the Popes Offering more acceptable? and ſince Chriſt alone can by the Law of <hi>Mechiſedecs</hi> Prieſt-hood, offer up his Body, and Blood; what is the Popes ſecond Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every Bull, but a moſt ſacrilegious Boldneſs? Will they ſay, that this Offering is merely intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſuch as every Chriſtian may do by praier? then ſay I, the Indulgence which the Pope ſells with this kind of Offering, is a mere Cheat; if it be more, it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:132423:126"/>is the Sacrilege. 2. Secondly what a rude extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, is it to offer to God for Paiment his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? and to preſent him with that which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready from an incompatably better hand? Is this fair and honeſt dealing, to pay one out of his own Purſe? and what Piece of Courtſhip is it in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to preſent his Prince with nothing elſe, then his own proper Roial Jewels?</p>
               <p>This is the truth of Chriſts Satisfaction: and Pope and Papiſts ſhould either learn, or teach it better. Chriſt having once offered to God a Ranſom moſt ſufficient to redeem all men, both from all ſins and all the Penalties which attend them; God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath accepted of it, for ſuch, at the hands of his Dear Son. Now the way of applying this great and infinite Sacrifice: and of rendring it as well all Efficacious to us, as it is al-ſufficient in it ſelf, is not to return it up to God, either by ordinary Prieſts at Maſs, or by Popes pretending to repay it him in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; (for this were rather the way of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to God, who gives, then to us who muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it) but to beg it of God through Chriſt by continual Praiers; to thirſt and long after it, by the ſenſe of our wants, and unworthineſs; to qualify our ſelves towards the receiving of it, by repenting; and then to embrace what God according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and promiſes will give; to embrace it, I ſay, with faith, and ſecure it to our ſelves by a conſtant courſe of holy life. Or to ſay the ſame in <hi>Roman</hi> terms. The Church hath an infinite Treſure, both of Satisfactions and Merits: out of which you may have as many <hi>Jubilees</hi> and Plenary Indulgences for all your Sins, and all the Penalties, whether eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or temporal that attend ſin, as you ſhall want.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:132423:127"/>This Treſure of Satisfactions hath already bin both ſo ſufficiently, and ſo efficaciouſly offered to God, by Chriſt and accepted of by God for you, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther Offering by Maſs Oblations or Popes Bulls, it ſtands alwaies before God, <hi>in his mind,</hi> and <hi>acceptation.</hi> God is pleaſed to offer it you, full as it is in his Goſpel; His Holy Sacraments, and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes are both his Bulls and Indulgences, and be ſure that you ſhall gain them, if you are but willing and earneſt to have them: Only know this, that Chriſt, who is the Steward, and the Diſpenſer of the Treſure, throws it not a way undiſcreetly on every ſinner, that bids mony. None of his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences are to be had <hi>ſine Cauſa rationabili,</hi> as the Bull-mongers uſe to ſpeak, without ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe, which is leaving the Pope, to come with repentance and Faith to Chriſt: inſtead of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Roſary</hi> Altar or an Image, to humble your ſelf, and walk uprightly both before God and before men. Now have you got the whole Treſure upon theſe reaſonable terms; you have the keies along with it, as far as your private concern reaches. Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, or continuing in any ſin, are the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary keies, that lock it up: holy Faith, and true Charity are the keies that get it open. There are keies of another kind, that belong to public Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Lawful Officers in the houſe of God. Theſe public keies are to lock out of it all ſuch wretches, as ſtand in the Church to ſhame it: and to open it to them again, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due proofs of Amendment, they ſhall watch and knock at her Gates. And this is more then perhaps you think; for altho directly they belong only to the Church, they do alſo conſequently both lock
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:132423:127"/>or open Gods good Treſure, and in ſome manner Heaven it ſelf. For tho Chriſt properly be the keeper of, as well as the way and the Gate of this Celeſtial Palace; take it for certain, that his Keies do ſhut or open his Kingdom, whenſoever <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or any other Lawful Biſhop, Lawfully ſhuts or opens the Church; and whenſoever alſo your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones ſhut or open your own Treſure. If <hi>Rome</hi> treſpaſs againſt the rule (as her keies may turn wrong, and not in the wards of the Catholic Church) your private ones ſhall ſerve your turn, and the keies of Chriſt will ſecond them. Theſe keies every true Chriſtian, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">p</hi> ſaies very well, doth keep and carry about him: and may with them attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tender Mercies of God, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt for all his ſins, without the Bull of any Pope. The very Papiſts do confeſs it, tho they do it in other words, when they ſay,

               <p>This one Reſervation makes all the trouble about Pardons, and ſo ſecures all the profit.

And God knows, how many Wretches both are drawn away to that Church, and there emboldened to ſin by this ſweer Enchantment. But when you think to have done all (for who is the honeſt Penitent that might not think to have done enough, when he hath freed himſelf from ſin, and from the eternal Miſery that follows it) there remains ſtill the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which may make you burn for every one of theſe ſins you think pardoned, in a Fire as hot as Hell, ſome ſay ſeven, ſome ten, others twenty Years, for every one of your Mortal Sins. You may hear God proteſting by moſt of the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>That if you turn and believe, He will not ſo much as remember your ſins any more.</hi> But <hi>Romes</hi> Purgatory Vengeance tells quite the contrary. You hear an Apoſtle preaching among the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, That there is no condemnation at all for them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. That is true for Hell, ſay now the Modern <hi>Romans,</hi> but not for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. You hear another Apoſtle telling you, <hi>That the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth you from all ſins,</hi> when you have committed any, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. but not, ſaies the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, from all the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Burnings which you muſt ſuffer. Nay more, theſe will tell you alſo, that
<note n="t" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bell. de Indulg. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> Chriſt hath moſt fully ſatisfied for all Sins and Puniſhments, both in Hell and in Purgatory: What can they ſay, and you wiſh more? one ſhould think ſo; but they only mock you. For Chriſt, ſay they, hath ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:132423:128"/>ſo for you, but 'tis upon condition, that you ſhall ſatisfie alſo for your ſelf. Good God! I thought my Savior had ſatisfied fully for all my Debts, if by Repenting and Believing, and leading a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life, I ſhould make my ſelf capable of his full Satisfaction. Now it ſeems he hath ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, in caſe I do ſatisfie it my ſelf; he hath freed me of all my Debts, if I pay them; he hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the full pardon of all my ſins, if I be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh'd for them. So I receive and may expect this favor, that I ſhall not be puniſh'd neither ſo long, nor in Hell; and that I ſhall not be drawn and quartered on Tower-hill, if I be hang'd at Tiborn. This certainly is no full Pardon, nor full Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor full Paiment. They ſay, it is, if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it well. It is full to all ends and purpoſes, when it is applied by Baptiſm; it is full after Baptiſm for all Mortal Sins and Eternal Puniſhments in Hell, if it be well applied by temporal and worldly pains. So I need not trouble my ſelf for Hell or Sin: But what muſt I do to free my ſelf from Purgatory? Here therefore is the Corner, where you muſt pay the utmoſt Farthing: Here in good earneſt lies all the trouble, and hence the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy gains the profit.</p>
               <p>For after you have bin at the trouble of continual Pilgrimages, Faſtings, Scourgings, and great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, no body can well aſſure you, that ſeven Years of ſuch hardſhips in this ſad Life, ſhall

You muſt have your recourſe to Maſſes, and redeem your ſelf out of that terrible Fire with whole thouſands of theſe, as they call them, <hi>Celestial Victimes,</hi> for they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:132423:129"/>properly are intended for that purpoſe: and many rich Men every day grudg not to deſtitute their Children, and to beſtow their vaſt Eſtates to this good end. How much this hath raiſed up the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you may ſee by thoſe vaſt Lands and Patrimonies which ſhe enjoies: and how little it can help poor Souls, you may ſee alſo by this, that after Millions of Maſſes ſo dearly bought, none of the Prieſts will think their Founders Souls ſo free from the pains of Purgatory, but they will ſell and ſing as many more, for their greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
               <p>In a word, after all is done which both Maſs and Maſs-Prieſts can do, there is no ſafety but in the Pope and Indulgences. If you will know what they Blaſpheme; Chriſt himſelf with his whole Body and all his Blood, tho a hundred times Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in a hundred Maſſes, is far ſhort of what the Pope can do in one plenary Indulgence; and, what Heaven and Earth may tremble at, his <hi>Roman</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſometimes applies more of Chriſts Blood in a ſingle piece of Parchment, then Chriſt himſelf will do in three or four thouſand Maſs-Sacrifices. Therefore beſides all you can get of the Maſs-Prieſts, with their Superceleſtial Victims, the Pope promiſes you far more out of his Celeſtial Store-houſe. This he can open as wide or little as he thinks fit: So you may have Bulls of all ſizes; ſome for 40 daies, <hi>Quadragens.</hi> Afterward they grew to one Year, as that ſolemn one which

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:132423:129"/>theſe ſmall Indulgences proved too weak and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificant to help one out of Purgatory: For alas! who can tell us, whether one ſin may not require as much or more, to be burnt out? therefore you may have larger Indulgences, even for hundreds and for thouſands of Years: ſuch is that which Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>

               <p>This way of meſuring Indulgences by a greater
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:132423:130"/>or leſſer number of Years, is, as it were an old Rag of the old Relaxations, which the Popes are pleaſed to tear off, either to blind or to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the newneſs of their Indulgences. The Primitive Church ſometimes did puniſh ſcandalous Men with Cenſures, that laſted, ſome five, ſome ten, ſome fifteen, and ſome twenty Years: and if ſhe ſaw reaſon for it, ſhe uſed to remit more or leſs of this time of humiliation, according as the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſeemed to make better uſe of it. Now the Pope by his Indulgences remits another kind of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhent, not that which the Church had laid, but that which God himſelf will lay on them; not in this life and in the Church, but after death and in Purgatory; not to make them a whit the better, but only to pleaſe his Juſtice. So becauſe they know well enough, that theſe new Indulgences of theirs are quite another thing then

Only they muſt betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when to make Indulgences more precious, they multiply twenties into thouſands, a number as inconſiſtent with the Cenſures, as with the Lives of Penitents in the Church of God, but compatible with their new waies of Penance in Purgatory. For whereas one, or two, or ſome few Years of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Relaxation, did tend only to take off ſome Years of their Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure; our <hi>Roman</hi> Relaxations and Indulgences intend to take off
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:132423:130"/>quite, or to abridge Gods Judgment, which may laſt upon burning Souls longer then the longeſt Bulls. And this is the ſenſe and meaning of their extravagant Calculation. Sir, you have from his Holineſs a Bull of forty thouſand Years; that is, a holy Privilege, by which you ſhall be

Every one of your Mortal Sins deſerves by ſome ancient Canons a
<note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellar. de Indulg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> Mortification of three, of ſeven, and ſome of ten Years and more: think how many ſuch lie upon you, and then peradventure you ſhal find, that tho an Indulgence of forty thouſand Years goes very far, it may be yet too ſhort for you.</p>
               <p>But if you be not pleaſed with this meſuring of Indulgences, becauſe how long and wide ſoever, it is upon many
<note n="e" place="bottom">Suarez. ſupra.</note> accounts uncertain, whereas the ſum which you pay for them is not ſo: take at your choice either partial, or plenary Indulgences, and then you ſhall know what you take. If you take a partial one, chuſe what piece of Pardon you pleaſe, whether to be freed from the Penances that your Confeſſor puts you to, or from the puniſhment of venial, or for half, a third or fourth part of Mortal Sins. I ſay this, becauſe beyond Sea I have known ſome great Perſons, who would not take Pardon for all, being informed by their Directors, that God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:132423:131"/>would be better glorified, if they ſhould expiate ſome part of them by Burning themſelves along with them in the Purgatory Fire. However, the Pope now hath the Blood and the Satisfactions of Chriſt ſo perfectly at his command, that he may &amp; will let you have of it, for as much and as little as you pleaſe. But if you have a mind to make clear work, and to be quit with Gods Juſtice upon all ſcores, take a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or a plenary Indulgence. A plenary Indulgence, (God in his great mercy forgive, and undeceive them who Blaſpheme ſo) is thought equivalent to Holy Baptiſm, and able to convey as much of Chriſts Blood upon you, as will waſh you clean from all your Sins; or at the leaſt, clear you from all Debts, from the very date of your Baptiſm, to the taking of the Indulgence.</p>
               <p>Yet this total or full Indulgence, admits of ſeveral degrees. For in Pope
<note n="f" place="bottom">Extravag. Antiquorum.</note> 
                  <hi>Boniface</hi>'s account, there are ſome that are more then full, <hi>Pleniores;</hi> ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet fuller then theſe, <hi>Pleniſſimae.</hi> Some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Champions are puzled at this gradation, and do not know how to take it, unleſs it be for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating Expreſſion, to ſwell ſomewhat the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and to lighten the Buyers purſe. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there is in the caſe ground enough for theſe, and more Gradations. 1. You may think to have gained a total Indulgence, becauſe it releaſes you of all the Puniſhment which can be laid on you by the Church; when you want another, to releaſe you from all other puniſhments, which may, either in Purgatory, or in ſome other place be laid on you, by God himſelf. 2. Suppoſe your plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence remits both theſe, <hi>Ab injunct is, &amp; debitis;</hi> it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:132423:131"/>commonly remits them no farther, then the time when it is applied to you, when being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dying, you are abſolv'd by it. But in caſe you live longer, tho it were but a Fortnight, your total Indulgence is ſpent; you want another, that may remit the ſins which you may fall into before you die. Therefore there is a fuller one, <hi>Plenior,</hi> that may ſerve you to your laſt breath. 3. There muſt be another yet fuller then this, for when you are in ſuch an extremity of either ſickneſs or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that apparently you cannot live, <hi>Articulus mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis praeſumtus,</hi> that is, the point

But yet you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps want a Prieſt to ſay your Abſolution: For tho theſe kind of Officers be common enough, even five or ſix in a Pariſh, yet they may be all ſinging their Maſs, when you are at home groaning to death. And in thoſe barbarous Countries, where Maſs-Prieſts are not ſo frequent, what will avail all your Indulgences, if you chance to die at <hi>Durham,</hi> when your Maſs-Prieſt is at <hi>New-caſtle?</hi> Therefore there are other fuller then thoſe, and moſt full and fulleſt,

When you have this, you have not yet all; for there is another ſort of ſins that this Indulgence, how large ſoever, takes, it may be, no notice of; to wit, all the ſins which you may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your ſelf into, by preſuming on the ſtrength of this Indulgence.

Yet I hear of ſome other great ones, and Saints too, who will except preſumtuous ſins, when they apply theſe large Pardons. For thus runs the Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

And in the caſe of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, which, if worth any thing, are nothing elſe then gracious Favors of the Pope, and real paiments out of Chriſts Purſe; Chriſt is ſuppoſed to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to part with his Blood, whenſoever the Pope parts with his Bull; and tho theſe Bulls be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it happens very often for quite other Ends then they pretend; Chriſts Blood and Satisfactions muſt wait on them, whether for pardoning mens Sins, or for <hi rend="sup">s</hi> emtying poor <hi>German</hi> Purſes; for arming Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> or the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt <hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Chriſtians: for the Building up of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, or for enriching the <hi rend="sup">u</hi> Nepotiſm: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging Divorcements, Adulteries, and very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts; for theſe and ſuch other good Ends I ſay, Chriſt is preſuppoſed to be as free to make good ſuch Bulls with his Blood, as the Pope is, when his own intereſt will have it ſo, to make them paſs under his Seal; However good Catholics when they buy them, believe it ſo. And this Belief is one of the greateſt Allurements, that draw new <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>NEXT to the Popes Bulls and Indulgences, the help of any honeſt Friend, that will take our Guilt upon himſelf: and the having ones Name entered into a Holy Confraternity, are two ready and eaſie waies of procuring Atonement. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is commodious in nothing more, then in finding out expedients either for removing quite away; or for ſhifting from one to another all perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhments. Have you committed Adultery, Extortion, or any Crime of this nature? Such grand Sins in the Auricular Confeſſion deſerve at the leaſt Faſting, and giving of Alms: but if you are not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing, or able to do it your ſelf; it is enough, if ſome of your kindred will do it for you. One ſhall faſt,

And this is the beſt of all; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall ſuffer all the hardſhip, when you enjoy the ſweet of ſins. And if you want ſuch honeſt Friends, as will do it out of kindneſs; you cannot want them, who will do much more for mony. All
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:132423:139"/>the World knows, what upon this account is don at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other Catholic Countries; there men are publicly hired to do Penance, and to whip themſelves to the blood, for the diſcharge of other mens ſins. Only, look well to theſe two things. 1. That the poor fellow, whom you hire to perform this Service for you, be an honeſt likely fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be in the eſtate of Grace; <hi>in ſtatu Gratiae;</hi> for fear his Faſtings and Laſhings otherwiſe, may chance not to be accepted either for you or for himſelf. 2. Get you before hand <hi rend="sup">b</hi> the Conſent of your Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who in that Caſe both will and may capacitate the ſelf-whipper: and by the Power of his keies, improve every laſh he gives himſelf, into an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Sacramental Satisfaction for you. The cuſtom is in ſome Countries to get a miſerable Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal on <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> to

<note n="q" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. n</hi> 6.</note> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evidenced by any convincing Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, becauſe whatever is brought out of Scripture to this purpoſe, proves no more, then a mutual help of Praiers to God by way of Impetration and Favor, which God may either grant or deny, as he pleaſeth; and not by way of a ſufficient <hi>Satisfaction</hi> or <hi>Paiment,</hi> which he is obliged to accept of. In a Word, that the common Opinion and ſenſe of the Church, (that is, the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy) is the only Evidence they have for this Conſtitution. But if this ground ſeem too Sandy, to bear any great weight with wiſe Men, ſeveral Revelations will be brought in to ſtrengthen it; and tho theſe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be neither from Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, what would you have better then the Virgin? I have told you already, how among many of her dear Villains, whom often ſhe ſuffers to live and to die moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, ſhe reſcued <hi>Baſſus</hi> out of Hell, and brought him up to life again, that he might have time to confeſs, and to get Friars in her Name, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

               <p>Upon this, and ſuch other Examples, the <hi>Roman Prieſts</hi> are directed

And the Confeſſor being deſired, may, upon due conſideration, undergo all the Penalties, which, being beſt transferred on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with his conſent, as it is ſaid, are better born out by himſelf. And that which is a great deal more, and may better pleaſe the Sinner, ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors will go ſo far, as to take upon themſelves the very ſin. Thus did, for Example, that both skilful and charitable Jeſuit

So upon a ſudden, here is the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in the former caſe of the Holy Jeſuit, and there the Jeſuit in the caſe of the Villain; and both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as it appeared ſoon after in a clear Revelation, that aſſured them whom it concerned, that the dead Noble-man had not any the leaſt Offence to anſwer for; and that the charitable Jeſuit had all both ſins and penalties clean wiped off, and a great deal of thanks given him beſides, for his extraordinary kindneſs. I know by what I have heard and ſeen my ſelf in great Houſes, that the ordinary Complement of Directors among Ladies, is, <hi>Icharge my ſelf, and

               <p>It is in this management of ſins, and tranſmitting and borrowing at diſcretion mutual Helps, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and Merits, that conſiſts moſt principally the great uſe of Confraternities.</p>
               <p>The Confraternities are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, what Corporations are in a Commonwealth, to wit, Companies and Societies, both of Monks, and other devout Catholics, united together by free conſent, and encouraged by great Indulgences and Spiritual Privileges, toward the undertaking or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſome ſpecial piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Devotion. There is ſcarce any Order of Monks, or any petty <hi>Roman</hi> Saint, but hath a Confraternity; and if the Saint be more famous, it is hard if one Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can ſerve his turn.

               <p n="3">3. But the main Benefit indeed, and the moſt earneſtly ſued after, by them who give their names to theſe admirable Companies, is that of exchanging their Guilt and Sins, with other Mens Satisfactions and good Works. The Proteſtants never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood well, how the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is skilful in ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on and off good and bad Deeds from one Man over to another. Firſt, There are in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity Saints, and other more common Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, endued with ſo many and great Merits, and ſatisfactory Works, that they have much to ſpare to others. Secondly, There are, as they ſay, in every one of theſe good Works two ſeveral diſtinct
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:132423:143"/>Virtues, to accommodate a poor Friend with; to wit, a Meritorious Influence, to procure him Grace, and an Expiatory Quality, to ſecure him from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Thirdly, they can order both Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to go juſt what way, and upon what Perſon they direct them. If the Owner feels any need of them for his own uſe, it is fit they ſhould ſtay at home; but if he wiſhes them for a Neighbor, this very wiſhing and actual Intention will ſo appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the whole buſineſs to whomſoever he pleaſes, that when he Praies, Faſts, Whips himſelf, and doth any act of like Piety; all this ſhall make the poor Sinner both as acceptable to God, <hi>ex Congruo,</hi> that is in equity, and as ſafe from Puniſhment, <hi>ex Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno,</hi> that is, in due courſe of Juſtice, as if he had done all himſelf. But in caſe the Holy Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by his work nothing elſe but to pleaſe God, and ſo thinks neither of his Friend nor of Himſelf; then it muſt be preſuppoſed, that he is alwaies for the good of his Corporation: and this, which they call Implicit or Virtual Intention, conveies all the Merit and Satisfaction of what he doth, not into the public Treſury, whence the Pope takes his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; but into theſe more private Magazins, which are proper to each Company, whence every Member takes what he wants. And if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two together, the Treſure of the Church may afford more Satisfactions to ſhelter one againſt Purgatory: but the ſtock of Confraternities is more proper for inveſting him with Merits, and advancing him to Gods Favor: Therefore Papal Indulgences,

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:132423:144"/>into a Fraternity</hi> (which all Catholics of all Ages and ſorts may do) <hi>is the better way to procure Grace.</hi> For whatſoever great Saints have ever deſerved of God in their life times, as S. <hi>Francis</hi> in teaching of Birds, and St. <hi>Dominic</hi> in making Beads, and all others in like holy Feats (beſides their Interceſſion and Patronage) is reſerved in, or hath a direct Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their reſpective Societies; that is the reaſon wherefore now adaies all ſorts of People, both high and low, Husbands and Wives, Nobles, and common Trades-men, throng to get in, and to have their names entred into theſe viſible Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries. And who is the ignorant or mad Sinner, that would not there provide himſelf with other Mens Satisfactions and Merits, when he knows he wants his own? Tho theſe ſaving Harbors be grown, and growing more and more beyond numbring, I will recommend to my Catholic Friends but theſe three. Namely, 1. The Confraternity of St. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Holy Rope.</hi> 2. That of St. <hi>Simon's Scapulary.</hi> 3. And that of <hi>S. Dominic</hi>'s 150 <hi>Beads.</hi>

               <p>PIOUS and Learned Authors have of late ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently informed the World, what kind of Saint S. <hi>Francis</hi> is. He is the Man, whom the Pope in a Prophetical Dream ſaw

<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibidem c.</hi> 4.</note> a clear Omen, that he was born to be the Light and the Chariot of the <hi>Roman</hi> World. He is the Man, who taking on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this vaſt Province, as he was by two ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations directed to ſave it, not by Praying only, (to which his ſimple <hi>Genius</hi> inclined more) but by Preaching. Firſt,
<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibidem c.</hi> 12.</note> He began ſtoutly with teaching Beaſts, and with Catechizing Swallows and Larks:

Laſtly, When he had rambled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the World by the ſpace of eighteen Years with many ſuch Fabulous Wonders, living all the while with his Followers on what they begged, and ſo eating, as he did call it, the Bread of Angels; he was, as they ſay, carried upon a certain Hill in <hi>Avergne, Alverniae Mons,</hi> at the time when he was Faſting to the honor of St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and there and then a <hi>Seraphim</hi>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:132423:145"/>for his good inſtructions. Thus this Superangelical Doctor in the year 1226 ended his daies: but ſo did not the ſtrange ſtories of his Miracles. During his life, which was a time, when Beaſts could learn Chriſtianity, and men diſcourſe of any thing; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the wonders he did, he had a ſpecial faculty to render pregnant and powerful any thing that had bin near him. I can juſtifie by
<note n="h" place="bottom">Sanctus Bonav. in vita Franc.</note> good Authors, (however the beſt that wrote his life) that his ſpittle reſtored ſight to a blind Maid: that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he had waſht his Feet, could cure all ſorts of diſeaſed Cattle: that any Crumb of Bread, which he had bit, did prove a Remedy againſt all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: that a ſmall Piece of Paper written with his hand, did preſerve an honeſt man, as long as he had it about him, from being diſquieted in his mind: that the Sign of the Croſs with the ſtroking of his finger, did expel all infirmities from the Body, that he had touched: that a ſmall handful of the Hey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly taken from his Mule, delivered once a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was dying in hard Travel. But the <hi>Frock,</hi> the Rope and the long Breeches, which had touched his holy wounds, were the moſt wonderful of all. I will lay aſide both Frock and Breeches, the Rope or Girdle being more pertinent to this purpoſe: and more then ſufficient beſides, to amaze men at Gods Judgments againſt thoſe, who leave plain Truth, to ſeek after Superſtitious waies.</p>
               <p>This is the Cord, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> had about him, wherewith one of his Diſciples, and which is more wonderful, a very diſcreet man withal, made once a ſhift to cure a whole Multitude of ſick people. His Method was, to dip in
<note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bonavent. ibid. c.</hi> 12.</note> water the end of this Rope,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:132423:146"/>and which you may well wonder at, the water ſuckt in out of the Rope, if you believe them, ſuch a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that being carried from houſe to houſe, and ſome few drops of it taken inwardly, it clear'd the Town at once of all manner of Diſeaſes. This was don when he was alive; when he was dead bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> that had a ſmall piece of the Rope, for then it had rubbed againſt the wound he had in his ſide; and this Rubbing, (you may well think) added great Vertue to the Relic. Poor <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> had a happy proof of it. For ſhe, after
<note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 13.</note> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pains and pangs, having her Child dead in her Womb about 4 daies, and her ſelf being even at Deaths door, after a devout motion called for ſome Relic of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> by good chance a ſmall bit of this Girdle of his was brought to her: and it was no ſooner applied to her Belly, but ſhe was preſently well: the Child came forth of it ſelf, and I cannot tell whether it came not to life alſo.</p>
               <p>Well then, it is to the Memory of this Rope, and to the Honor of the great Saint who made it his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that his Holineſs Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift thought himſelf bound in conſcience, and by the
<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. <hi>Constit.</hi> 13.</note> care he had of all Chriſtian people, to erect a famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity of men and women, whoſoever will vow and give their Names for the wearing of a Rope in outward faſhion ſomewhat like to his.</p>
               <p>The End, which this Inſtitution aims at, as it is expreſſed in the Bull, is the greater Worſhip and Veneration of S. <hi>Francis. Gregory</hi> the Ninth is the firſt who made him a Saint; with this Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that by his illiterate

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:132423:146"/>and as <hi>Samſon</hi> did before him, with the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe, he had don all. <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4th and <hi>Alexander</hi> the 4th afterwards thought good to Canonize his five Sores alſo, but with a handſomer Character,
<note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Alexand.</hi> 4. <hi>Constit.</hi> 4.</note> to wit of a <hi>Giant</hi> pulling up all men out of hell. Now Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="bottom">Suprà.</note> the fift has honor'd his Rope: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after it may be, his Holineſs will do as much for his old Shoes, or for his Breeches. Mean while, the work and task of this Confraternity in order both to conferring greater honor upon the Saint, and the better facilitating the
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. <hi>Constit.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> Eternal Salvation of our poor Souls, is to wear inſteed of a ſilk Girdle, ſuch a Cord as he did, about our Loines.</p>
               <p>This venerable <hi>Badge</hi> of being (as well as Sheep, and Aſſes were) ſome of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his Diſciples, is to them that wear it, a Cord twiſted of three infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bleſſings. 1. The Protection of a great Saint. 2. The Title to all the Pardons, granted by Popes. 3. The happineſs of being accommodated in time of need, with all the Satisfactions and Merits of this great Confraternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their hope is, that the Protection of S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> cannot fail them, who wear this Rope. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it be not the ſelf ſame that rubbed againſt his Fleſh and Wounds: yet it is thought to be like it: and the devotion of wearing it upon this account, may enough and enough ſupply the want of being the ſame. Saint Cardinal <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who was one of his beſt Diſciples, can inform you ſufficiently, how great a lover this Saint was in his life time of any thing that came near him; be it man or Beaſt, Hare or Partridge, Sheep or Lamb or Wolf, or
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:132423:147"/>what you will. And at his Death this Love increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according as his Power did; ſo that you can ſcarce think of any Miracle, that he would not do, to help a Friend upon this ſcore. I am not good at telling ſtories, and if I were, I would not thus trifle away time; but you may take it on my credit, that if the beſt popiſh Authors be true; it is but crying out, S. <hi>Francis help:</hi> or trying, whether he can help, when other Saints can, or will not: or Giving a poor man any thing, when you need it as much as he: or promiſing to cover his Altar with a clean Cloth; or to keep his holy Day, or to do ſome ſuch like pretty thing to any thing that relates to him; if he be ſtill as kind, as he was when the Pope Canonized him; you may ſafely look for at his hands the greateſt deliverances. It is upon ſuch and meaner terms, that he was uſed to
<note n="p" place="bottom">Aloyſ. Lippom. ad Finem vitae S. Franciſici.</note> raiſe the Dead: to enable Women being fourſcore years old, to be milch-nurſes: and to help men and Beaſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly from the moſt deſperate Dangers. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things you may admire his Nimbleneſs to come, when called. For how many men and Children hath he ſaved from touching the Ground tho they were fallen
<note n="q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> already from the high Loft or the window, before he was called? Commend me now to ſuch a Saint for all ſudden purpoſes and turns; and doubt not, but he that can but ſay, S. <hi>Francis look here, I wear your Girdle,</hi> may be as ſure of his Favor, as he that ſaid, <hi>O good Father remember now, that once I lent you mine Aſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond great Bleſſing in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this Cord can pull down on the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics who wear it, is the great Abundance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:132423:147"/>even as great, as both the greateſt ſinner can want, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Treſure can afford. It ſeems the Popes having ſome ground to be jealous, leſt wiſer Ages ſhould neglect either ſuch a Saint as S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or ſuch a means of Salvation as this <hi>Rope;</hi> have ſecured both, the beſt they could by encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men towards both, by large ſupplies of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. 1. At the firſt taking of this Cord (when it is bleſſed and conſecrated by the Superior of the Order) a Catholic may be as ſure to have all his ſins
<note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. <hi>Institut. Archiconfrat. Choxdiger. n.</hi> 3.</note> forgiven him, as any faithful <hi>Proſelyte</hi> may be at his Going to the holy Baptiſm. 2. Let one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe to his old ſins, or fall to new; he is ſure of a new <hi>Jordan</hi> ſtreaming all along down the Streets, where <hi>Naaman</hi> may waſh, and be clean; I mean a moſt plenary Indulgence
<note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Id. Extenſ. de Conſtit. n.</hi> 3.</note> waiting on them, who walk after the Monthly Proceſſion. 3. If this be not enough, (which it is impoſſible, but it ſhould,) they have for greater ſecurity all the Pardons, that ever were granted to the whole Order. And this is not a ſimple <hi>Jordan,</hi> but a whole Sea; ſince by this means all the Privileges and Indulgences, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any account whatſoever, are granted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects and Capucins, and to the very Chappel of Angels, may run into this Channel. So the ſinner being let down with his Cord, hath wherewith to waſh over head, and ears both himſelf, and whom he pleaſes. 4. Moreover and above all theſe Pardons, which belong to the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order; they may accommodate themſelves with all thoſe, that are granted to the Confraternity
<note n="t" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Idem Conſtitut. n.</hi> 3.</note> of <hi>Confalo;</hi> and the Stations of <hi>Rome</hi> beſides; which is heaping Sea upon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:132423:148"/>Sea; however more then a thouſand times enough, to waſh <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> and whatever may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proper Fewel for the Purgatory Fire. 5. Finally to make all this ſafe; theſe full Expiations attend the Rope, and the perſons who do wear it, to the laſt moment, they can ſin in
<note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Mortis Articulo.</hi> And now let the Devil if he dare, venture upon true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, having about their Loins ſuch a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third great Benefit, and therefore the moſt lookt after by this Corded Fraternity, is that which the Brethren and Siſters have, of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating themſelves every day with the Merits of other men, as the <hi>Jackdaw</hi> did it once with the Feathers of other Birds; when they have none of their own. This great Arch Confraternity hath ever bin bleſſed with great Saints, and conſequently with great ſtores of ſatisfactions and Merits. It is likely their firſt Founder alone, great S. <hi>Francis,</hi> hath by his prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Mortifications merited more, then the moſt diſſolute can ever need, to ſecure their worſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches; and if you conſider well, what an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Feat that was in him to throw and rub him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt Bundles of Thorns, and Women made of Snow, merely to tame or cool his Fleſh; you will confeſs that a great deal of this muſt needs come to their ſhare, who cannot do ſo. Hereafter Catholic Ladies may ſafely exchange Churches for Play-houſes; S. <hi>Roſe,</hi> and <hi>Santa Clara,</hi> the firſt Virgins, who took this Order have left Devotions for them more then they want. And ſuppoſe that the Well could ever come to be drawn dry; this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity never wants great and living Saints, who
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:132423:148"/>ſupply it daily with freſh Waters. And he is an unlucky <hi>Ruffian,</hi> who cannot get one of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to laſh and cut his poor old skin, for all what young Fleſh may deſerve. Only let the young Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and the Sweet Miſſes be devoted to S. <hi>Francis;</hi> have his Image in their Cloſets; and wear his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. But and if this wearing be troubleſom, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to tender Ladies under their long and ſtreight Bodies; a prudent Confeſſor can ſoon put them in another way of attaining Salvation, which ſhall hurt neither Back, nor Sides: and that is the <hi>Scapulary,</hi> the gentle wearing of S. <hi>Simon,</hi> which of my eſpecial knowledge the niceſt Perſons now beyond Sea, have commonly about their Shoulders.</p>

               <p>This was Encouragement enough to allure Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to this happy Confraternity; yet theſe <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi> were ſtrangers, and as it is uſual, envied by the Mendicant Orders growing much about the ſame time, they had much ado to take root, till the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> appear'd for them a ſecond time and to a much better purpoſe. The <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, for the moſt part, if they have but time to confeſs, are not much afraid of the eternal fire in Hell: but they terribly fear the Temporal Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; to this effect therefore came the ſame Lady from above; and declared in the preſence of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22th, then reſiding at <hi>Avignion,</hi> that once a week, about every <hi>Saturday</hi> night, ſhe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after would not fail to come down
<note n="*" place="bottom">Bull. Sabb.</note> to Purgatory; and thence pull all and every Soul, which ſhe ſhall find to have worn that ſacred Habit. This being proclamed by an Authentic Bull, and by a Pope, for thoſe daies of great Learning, brought the <hi>Scapulary</hi> into great requeſt. And ſince that time men may be thought to deſerve well all the Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Burnings, whoſoever would be ſo untoward, as not to prevent that danger, when they can do it upon ſo reaſonable terms: Eſpecially now, when it is made moſt eaſy and commodious in behalf of Perſons of the greateſt quality, for wearing, under the gentileſt Doublets or Bodies. There are ſome words, and Forms of Bleſſing, to conſecrate this little Habit into a ſaving Apparel. There are alſo ſome few Reſtraints put upon them that do wear it; a Maid muſt keep her Virginity: a Wife, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Faith, and a Widow, her Chaſtity, &amp;c. But if they happen to treſpaſs; they all know, when
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:132423:150"/>and how and where, to be eaſily abſolved. For the putting on of this Habit, procures a threefold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the way of <hi>Roman</hi> Salvation. 1. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and Pardon of ſins. 2. All the Favor and Protection of the Virgin of <hi>Mount Carmel. 3.</hi> A plentiful ſupply of all the <hi>Meritorious</hi> and <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> works belonging to the Society.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Benefit of Indulgences moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternities equal or exceed this; and here you may find the Popes backward, or much ſaving, in the diſtribution of their Pardons. For, whereas other Confraternities have ſeldom leſs then a full Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all ſins, at the Entrance; this hath but a third part of them in the great <hi>Sabbatine Bull.</hi> They allow but 40 daies Pardon for ſaying ſeven <hi>Paters</hi> and <hi>Aves</hi> to the honor of the ſeven Joies: but 100, for the little Office: but 300, for eating no fleſh on <hi>Saturdaies:</hi> but 500, and ſome few <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantains,</hi> for waiting on the conſecrated Hoſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Confraternities of far leſſer importance then that is, have much more. Witneſs that of S. <hi>Benedict, S. Scholaſtica,</hi> and <hi>S. Rochus.</hi> And yet tho the Popes on this account did ſo little; they did it for the moſt part, but when they were forced to it by ſtrong and irreſiſtible Impulſes. The Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as they ſay,
<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Palconydor. Antiquit. Carmelit. l.</hi> 3.</note> was fain to threaten <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and to tell him of two chief Officers of his, who had bin already deſtroied by Gods Vengeance, for neglecting her <hi>Carmelites,</hi> before this Pope could be brought to confirm their Order: and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had an Expreſs a while after from the ſame Lady, before he would do them Right againſt their envying Neighbors. By this it ſeems the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:132423:151"/>Lady had done for them ſo much before, that the Popes were unwilling, for their own profit, as in the caſe of the Chappel of Angels, to do much more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the truth is, if theſe Apparitions to <hi>S. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and to <hi>John</hi> the 22th be true; the Scapulary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity hath abundantly enough in her Boſom, to enrich all her needieſt Members, without any beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Scapulary</hi> alone well applied to the Breaſt and Back, is by it ſelf a great Jewel. It may, as they ſay, preſerve mens lives better then the ſtrongeſt Armor, againſt all temporal Dangers: and if you hearken to them all, they will come to you with hundred ſtories, what of women deliver'd, ſome

And as to the profest Brethren of this ſaid Order, they ſhall be delivered both from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Sin.

               <p>This new and admirable way of praying to God, by ſaying <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> hath, as they ſay, proved in their Church ſo ſucceſsful, for raiſing Hearts to Devotion, ſanctifying Men, extirpating all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and propagating Catholic Light, as it appears by

<note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pauius de Angelis. Deſcript. Baſil.

So the <hi>Greeks</hi> being cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, ran away, and threw their Booty into a Well, whence Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſoon took it up. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a main difficulty troubled the Church, to know which was the Body of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> at laſt, after much Faſting and Praying, a great Voice was heard from above (whence the Queen of Heaven uſes to appear) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora Oſſa, &amp;c. The bigger Bones belong to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the other to the Fiſher.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:132423:164"/>
               <p>By this good care of ill Spirits, both all the Bones and other Relics, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath now, are ſince multiplied to ſuch a number, as may deſervedly call again both the Chriſtians and Pagans together, to wonder at this Improvement. No Rats or Mice can multiply ſo faſt in naſty Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as Relics will in fooliſh Churches. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaies,
<note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In Matth.</hi> 23.</note> That the true Croſs, which once a Man could well carry upon his back, is ſince that time multiplied to ſo many pieces, that, if they were all put together, might very well load a good Barge. It is moſt certain, that our Savior was never Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed but once, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had but one Body, and St. <hi>Denis</hi> but one Head, while they lived: the ſame is true of the Wiſe men, or the three Kings. But now ſee where their Relics are beſt kept, to wit, at <hi>Rome, Bruxels, Paris, Milan, Ratisbone,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, whether now, when they are dead, they have no more. It ſeems the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath a notable faculty of making Bodies, Heads, and Teeth, and all other ſuch things to breed, while ſhe keeps them in her Boſom. This faculty is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Tranſubſtantiation, as when they put one individual Body in a thouſand places: nor by ſimple Diviſion, as when they break one of their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Wafers into parcels, whereof one, and even the leaſt, conteins as much as the whole doth; this is performed by a certain Efflux &amp; Tranſmigration of <hi>Roman</hi> Grace, ſuch as you ſee in a burning Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, when it lights as many others as you are pleaſ'd to bring to it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Roman</hi> Church thinks to know by infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Experiences, the gift, which their Holy things
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:132423:164"/>have of imparting their good Talent, to any thing which comes near them. If they but put their Beads, or any ſuch little thing on their long ſtick, as the Jews did their Sponge on a Reed, and then with a low bowing, make it kiſs our Ladies Image; this gentle touch is a Bleſſing: and I am ſure all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Beads, which have had it, are bought and ſold at a good price. If this touch be between ſuch things, as are of the ſame or like nature, then the Transfuſion of Holineſs is much ſtronger: and for example, a burning Taper, which will perhaps but heat the finger, will preſently light a Candle. And to this purpoſe is the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Suffragan <hi>Matthias</hi>'s public acknowledgment, when he declared ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he had from his Holineſs a Commiſſion to hallow, or to conſecrate any Bone, even of a Hog or a Sheep, if it were of the like member with that one which he had, into Relics fit for Altars. Here I cannot forget that

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:132423:166"/>a long Pole. At the firſt ſtepping into the Church, light one of them at the new Fire: then lift it up: and let the People ſay <hi>Deo gratias, God be thanked, there is Chriſts light.</hi> When you come to the middle of the Church; light the Second; and falling down upon your knees repete the ſame words ſomewhat louder: and when you are come in ſo far, as to the High Altar; then light me the third Candle, and cry out as loud as you can, <hi>Here is Chriſts light.</hi> This done, go up to the Pulpit; and there with one of the three afore ſaid Candles, light a fourth, but a huge one, which is called <hi>Cereus,</hi> and muſt be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole night.

               <p>Thirdly, from the Wax you go to the Oil; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of it three other great Organs of Grace; 1.

                  <note n="m" place="bottom">Pontifical. Roman. in Caena Domini.</note> ℞ Take me three Bottles full of the beſt and pureſt Virgin Oil you can get: cover them well; the two former, with ſilk of any Golor: but the third by all means with white; then when the Bells have rung a while, and all things are ready for the Office; let one Sub-Deacon, or more, bring the three Bottles orderly one after another, on his left Arm, (where the Lady carries her Babe) and deliver them being decently covered, into the hand of a more noble Officer, who ſhall name what Bottle it is; as for Example <hi>Oleum Infirmorum, Here is the Oil for dying People:</hi> and ſo ſet it before the Biſhop, upon a little Table near the Altar. At that moment the Biſhop ſhall riſe up: and with a pretty low voice (not ſo low nevertheleſs, as when he changes Bread into Fleſh) thus conjure and conſecrate the Bottle ſet before him. <hi>I conjure thee,</hi> ſhall he ſay, <hi>O thou most unclean Spirit, and all you Apparitions, and Incurſions of the Devil, to get forth out of this Oil in the Name of the Father, &amp;c. that it may become a Ghoſtly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, fit to streng then the Temple of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi> Then follows the ſolemn Conſecration; <hi>that God would be pleaſed to ſend down the holy Comforter, out of Heaven into this Fatneſs of Olives, that it may ſcatter all the Pains, all the Infirmities, and all the ſorrows both of the Soul and Body: and that it may be a ſafeguard and restauration to them, who ſhall be anointed with it.</hi> After this, muſt the two other Bottles be brought up, on the left arm likewiſe, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:132423:168"/>with more Ceremony; for the <hi>Chorus</hi> muſt ſing the <hi>Verſe</hi> or as they call it the <hi>Charm, O Redemtor,</hi> &amp;c. four or five times: and the high Maſs Prieſt muſt conſecrate the <hi>Balſam,</hi> and mingle it with ſome of the Oil, in a leſſer Diſh or Patin. This don, he blows three times croſs-wiſe over the Mouth of the greater, otherwiſe called the <hi>Chriſmal</hi> Bottle. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him twelve other Maſs Prieſts, but of an inferior Dignity, who ſtand ready for the ſame purpoſe, blow each in order thrice, and croſs-wiſe on the ſaid Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Then here follows the Conjuring Conſecration. <hi>Exorcizo te,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>I do exerciſe thee by God the Father Almighty O thou Creature of Oil, that all the Armies of the Devil, and all the Incurſions of Satan may flee away out of thee: and that thou maiest become to them, who ſhall be anointed with thee, an Adoption of Sons, by the Holy Ghost; in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. Having thus conjured and praied, he falls upon ſinging the Praiſes of this Chriſmal Oil, calling upon the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as impertinently, as before, <hi>that the Vertue of the Holy Ghost may be mingled with the Fatneſs of this Oil,</hi> juſt as he (the High Maſs Prieſt) mingles what is upon the little Diſh, or Patin, and lets it in into the Bottle, with a <hi>Fiat,</hi> that is wiſhing or commanding, <hi>that this mixture of Liquors be a ſaving Propitiation, and ſafe guard to them, who ſhall anoint themſelves with it.</hi> And in full aſſurance that it is ſo, the Inferior Prieſt takes off the white Veil, which this Bottle was hooded with; then the High Prieſt with a threefold humble kneeling, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips the Bottle three times together, ſaying at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kneeling and ſalute, <hi>Ave Sanctum Chriſma;</hi> but raiſing his voice by ſet degrees (for this belongs to the Myſtery) at the ſecond, and the third time:
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:132423:168"/>the reſt of the preſent Clergy do ſomewhat more; for at every <hi>Ave</hi> in ſeveral notes, as before, inſtead of bowing, where they ſtood, they muſt approach, and kneel before the Bottle; call it worſhip, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or what you pleaſe. Laſtly both the High and low Maſs Prieſts do moſt reverently kiſs in order not the Mouth, as before, but only the <hi>Lip of the Bottle, Labium Ampullae.</hi> Nothing of all this is don in vain; and nothing can be don too much; for this is the great <hi>Chriſmal Ointment,</hi> which ſupplies the want of Baptiſm: and which arms the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics with all Graces, not one excepted, againſt all Temtations whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The third Bottle conteins what they call, <hi>the Oil of the Catechumens:</hi> which, laying <hi>Balſam</hi> aſide, is conſecrated as the former; for the High and the 12 low Maſs-Prieſts, blow thrice on it; then it is conjured and praied over, <hi>that all the Devils may flee from it: and that ſo many Graces may come into their Places, as both to adopt and to purifie the Fleſh and the Spirit of all, who ſhall therewith be liquored.</hi> For the Concluſion they all worſhip the third Bottle as they did the ſecond, with their repeting <hi>Ave San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Oleum, I worſhip or Salute thee O Holy Oil.</hi> So you have all you can deſire to ſet your Salvation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againſt the world, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> knows how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Salt, and water, either each by it ſelf, or both together, by Conjuring, them into another
<note n="n" place="bottom">Pontifical. Rom. ſect. De Benedict. primi Lapiddis.</note>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:132423:169"/>ſide: then all ill Spirits, and uncleanneſs muſt fly away: and then the aſſiſting Preſence of the Holy Ghoſt comes in good earneſt about you. That is the reaſon, that no wiſe Catholic will paſs one day, if he can help it, without ſprinkling himſelf with this water; nor let the Chamber, where he lies, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a little Bottle full of this holy Preſervative.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church affords two other great Saving

But it ſhews it eſpecially, when the Maſs Biſhop hath mixed it with the ſaid Aſhes, Salt and Holy water, therewith to hallow Churches, Altars, and all other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Catholic Devotion, with ſuch admirable Properties, as can make all Services more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, this is one of the greateſt Perfections and Allurements of <hi>Rome;</hi> that over and above the many Means of Inherent Bleſſings, to enable the deadeſt Souls towards ſomething; ſhe can enable Marble, Wood and Stone, to raiſe and quicken the leaſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. And for my mony give me ſuch a Maſter,

And what hard matter can it be for an old Sinner on his Death-bed, either to kiſs a Crucifix, or to hold a conſecrated Candle, when contrariwiſe he finds it an unſufferable task to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?

For what worſe abuſe can there be, then to call on the Holy Ghoſt to infuſe his Light, his Grace, and the Dew of his Bleſſing into Aſhes, Stones, and Morter made of Water, Lime and Sand? In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are theſe dirty things capable of any Grace, and Spiritual Infuſion? Or is the bleſſed Spirit of God become to us ſo contemtible, as to be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Dirt? 2. What impudent attemt is this, to pretend, either by our Praiers, or by the help of light Geſtures, to raiſe up filly Elements to high prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Effects? And what viſible temting of God is it, to call on him for Help, Grace and Bleſſing, upon this proſtitute boldneſs? For when we call upon him to Bleſs or to Sanctifie what we have, it is to improve it to thoſe uſes, which by its nature it is fit for. And when we bleſs the Elements, either for holy Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, or for the holy Communion; it is to procure then a Bleſſing in order to thoſe Spiritual Ends, that he himſelf hath ordained both Baptiſm and holy Communion to.

There and then the Men of God neither ſpoke nor did any thing, but when moved by his Spirit: and without ſuch Grounds and Principles, whether natural, or better, all our Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are but Faithleſs, and our Bleſſngs and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations unchriſtian. Now what of all this, can a Maſs-Prieſt or Biſhop pretend for all his Conjurings? If Lights and Lamps can by their Natural proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſcatter Darkneſs, or by an human Inſtitution repreſent Glory and Joy: Can they alſo procure Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and cure Diſeaſes?

Is a rag either of Silk, or of Cotton, being at a certain time dipt in Oil, like to give eaſe and refreſhment to a dead Pope lying on it? Or if Nature fail them in this: What Divine Inſtitution, what true Revelation have they to make them think, that their three Bottles, if a Maſs-Biſhop will breath on them, ſhall fetch down Graces from above? and that one little drop of this Oil, mingled with Wax and Balſam, ſhall ſave People againſt all Dangers? Why ſhould one think that his Pariſh Church is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freed from ill Spirits, by ſome few Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Letters made with a ſtick upon ſpread Aſhes, then his Room is, if he writes Slut with his Finger upon a naſty or dirty Board? And what ails a Tulip more then a Roſe, or an old Shoe more then a Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, not to be as well conſecrated to great Marvels? 3. As 'tis to theſe and other ſuch idle purpoſes, that the Holy and Dreadful Name of God is by them all taken up, and called upon at every turn; if in truth,

Thus the Devils are beſt pleaſed, when they trample both on Nature and Grace, both on Gods good Creatures, and Chriſts ſacred Ordinances. You can no where find more of this then both in the Jewiſh <hi>Talmud,</hi> and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations of <hi>Rome.</hi> No Salt, no Wine, no Smoak, no ſound of ſtrange Words and Characters, can be out of their way and uſe, in order to true Popery: and if Chriſt, and the Primitive Fathers, ever uſed any of theſe Creatures to a Moral and Myſtical ſenſe, the Papiſts will firſt ſtretch it out to extravagant Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, and at the concluſion will abuſe it for the working out of ſtrange Feats. Thus the uſe of Oil, which by the Fathers was applied to repreſent the Graces of the Holy Ghoſt, falls into the hands of Papiſts to cure Diſeaſes. Thus the ringing of the Bells is improved from calling the People to Church, to make Corn proſper in the Fields: and thus the Bones of dead Saints, and the very Sacrament of the Lord, from being kept as holy Memorials; to be thrown to quench the Fire, and to ſave Houſes.

                  <hi>Concerning the moſt general, and moſt ſenſible Inducement to Popery, by the means and in the uſe of Conſecrated Images.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BOTH the firſt ſcope and moſt difficult work of Chriſtian Religion concerning Mankind, is to raiſe up their Souls from low and groſs viſible Creatures, to God himſelf and all Spiritual Objects. Contrariwiſe, the main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heatheniſh Superſtitions, was ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to conſiſt in depreſſing Men from God, and all ſuperceleſtial thoughts, down as low as ever they could, to groſs and ſenſual Idols. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the eaſier Task, becauſe human corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (all good or bad Religions being laid aſide) is apt and prone to move downwards, by the very weight of its Principles. Men naturally do love as little to look up, or to employ themſelves about inviſible Matters, as to gaze at random on emty Air: and being guided only by their Senſes, it is exceeding hard for them to take any other way, but towards what they ſee and touch. Hence <hi>Rome</hi> hath taken the advantage to fit her own Religion from what true Chriſtianity preſcribes, to what ſenſual Men can or will do. For as to what they can; if to love God with all their hearts, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him in Spirit, be much above their Moral
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:132423:175"/>ſtrength; to bow paſſing by an Altar, or to ſprinkle themſelves with Holy Water, or to ſtand or kneel demurely at the lifting up of a Wafer, are ſuch acts of Devotion, as any one, who hath but ſome health, and the natural uſe of his Members, hath ſufficient ability to perform. And as to what they affect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho all ſpiritual Exerciſes and mental Elevations, be to them unpleaſing; and all pure and eternal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects very far above their ſight, and farther yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their care; yet they will kiſs a Crucifix, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a Croſs, carry moſt devoutly a Scapulary, an <hi>Agnus,</hi> or a ſet of Beads about them: and theſe and other like Devotions, as I have ſhewed in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, go far in the Roman Account. And as to the great Zeal and Paſſion which the Goſpel of Chriſt requires, tho few Men can force themſelves ſo much, as patiently to hear one Preaching upon any Eſſential Article of the Chriſtian Faith; yet all of their own accord, eſpecially upon certain daies, will throng both to ſee and to worſhip St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Head, or St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tooth. And without any great teaching, Men learn preſently any where, what moſt <hi>Iſraelites</hi> learn'd in <hi>Egypt;</hi> when they care little for God or for <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom they ſee not, they will gape and run luſtily after the Calf, or any thing which they can ſee. Thus evidently, <hi>Let us make Gods to go before us,</hi> is the moſt corrupt natural wiſh, and the moſt univerſal Religion of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. To this purpoſe, the Holy Fathers have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this Enchantment in Images, that the very Men that ſhould beſt know what ſtuff theſe Idols are made of, yet will ſtand in ſome

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:132423:176"/>multitude; and that either ſuch is the Charm of theſe dead figures

<note n="c" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note> their back to their own God, and turn their Face to his Image. The truth is, carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, ſuch as naturally all Men are, are all for preſent carnal Objects: and if theſe have alſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhapes, in St. <hi>Augustins</hi> Judgment, this likeneſs becomes to them ſo great a Charm, that, as the ſame Father obſerves, Men ſhall not be diſcouraged from following after Images, by ſeeing them both Deaf, Blind, and Dumb, but will take them for friendly Gods, becauſe they ſee them have Ears, Eyes, and Mouths. Whatever this Reaſon be worth, this Experience is moſt certain, that, the People of God excepted, all the World beſides hath bin drawn to their reſpective Religions, by the help of theſe groſs Images: and if by chance, any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Nation happened to have none, that is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by moſt Hiſtorians as extraordinary and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. All the Provinces of <hi>China,</hi> however full as they ſay of Teachers, who think of God, much above all what an Image can repreſent; yet never draw up their Train'd Bands to any Religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn purpoſe, but ſtill march with ſuch Standards; and the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and the Primitive Church of Chriſt, are the only two Societies that both had not, and deteſted Image Worſhip. Not to ſpeak of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> according to the Fleſh, of which there is no queſtion, the Church of Chriſt,

If there were Images at all to be ſeen among Chriſtians, during the three firſt and moſt Virgin Centuries, they were either kept uſeleſs in private hands, or uſed by the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Simon</hi> the

When firſt Images crept into Churches, which was about the ſixth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, it was on a civil account, either as Ornaments of Chriſtian Temples, or as Memorials of Holy Stories. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, and the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Images,

Then ſoon after came the ninth Century, noted by all for the worſt, the ſaddeſt, and the ignoranteſt Age of the Church, which drowned the Goſpel with Popery, and which, as their beſt Authors
<note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Baronius, an</hi> 900. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</note> confeſs, began in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſet up the <hi>Abominable Deſolation</hi> foretold by <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And ſo Images had a fair opportunity to come in, when both the Holy Scriptures were kept unknown, under the Buſhel
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:132423:177"/>of Ignorance: and when all other things were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by new Revelations and new Miracles. Here I do not undertake to ſhew, how far <hi>Roman</hi> Images lead worſhippers into the way of plain Pagan Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; ſince able men have done it before. But what is proper to my purpoſe, and is not ſo generally known; I will inſiſt 1. upon their Roman Original. Secondly, upon their uſe among Papiſts. Thirdly, and moſt principally, upon what good, or bad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, Roman Images are grown ſo lovely and ſo taking.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, as to the Original of <hi>Roman</hi> Images, it imitates that of Roman Relics. So the Papiſts have them two waies; for ſome are made by the Roman Church; others have an unknown Extraction, as being ſuppoſed either made by ſome Saint; or brought down from Heaven by Angels; or however found out one way or other by ſome extraordinary Providence. The Images made by the Roman Church, are made this way; the Carpenter cuts down a Tree, or the Maſon digs out a Stone: then a Carver works this Stone, or Tree into an Image: and the Maſs-Biſhop conſecrates both, into a Saint, or a Virgin, or a Crucifix. In the joint labor and concurrence of theſe three Craftsmen; the firſt finds the Materials: the ſecond adds the ſhape and Figure: and the third, that is the Maſs Biſhop, puts in the Eſſential form, the very Soul; and by his powerful Conſecration introduces it into the Body of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in this manner.</p>
               <p>When the Church wants a Crucifix, the Biſhop puts off his Miter; and in a pretty long Office, declares or explains to God, what he would have, that is, what it is that he hath a mind to ſet up; namely
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:132423:177"/>
                  <hi>Singulare Signum,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Pontifical. Rom. ſect. De Benedict. Nov.

If the Crucifix be made of ſome better matter then common Wood, as of ſome fine Stone, Braſs, or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; it is intended and praied for, that by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of this Crucifix, all devout Worſhippers may be cleanſed from all their ſins, as the world was by the Holineſs of Chriſts Croſs. In order to theſe great Deſigns, the Biſhop makes uſe of Holy Water; not ſuch ordinary holy water, as Maſs Prieſts make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sunday, for every body to keep off Devils and Diſeaſes: nor ſuch, tho nobler, as is uſed at every Chriſtening of Children: but that nobleſt ſort of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, which a Pope,

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:132423:178"/>For concluſion, the Maſs Biſhop devoutly

<note n="d" place="bottom">Pontif. Rom. de Bened. Imag. B. M.</note> of our Lady, are conſecrated in the ſame way, with the ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt holy water, and the burning of Incenſe; only they have this ſpecial Praier more; to wit, that God
<note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid. Item ſect. Bened. Imag. aliorum. S. S.</note> Almighty would be pleaſed ſo to ſanctifie the ſaid Images, that whoſoever ſhall pray before them, may never want the Mediation and Interceſſion of that Saint, who owns the Image, to promote all what he praies for. Where by the bie you may diſcern Blaſphemy and Impertinence coupled together; A Blaſphemy, in calling upon God to bleſs that which in his ſervice he ſo profeſſedly curſes and deteſts; and the Impertinency, in praying Backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; forward to God, to move or get his Saints to mediate: and backward to move or get their God to the hearing of all the Requeſts, that ſhall be made before their Image. A Mathematical Device indeed an Image is (and who would not have ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) to turn God down to any Saint: and to turn up any Saint to God; and both God and Saints, to what one ſaies, when he kneels before that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>To ſpare Gods Name out of the Caſe, (for it is both a moſt fearful boldneſs to go to God for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon what he hates and condemns, and a moſt deſperate folly, to believe that He will grant it) a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:132423:178"/>Child might ſee both in the drift, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe Conſecrations, that the main deſign of Images is not, to ſet up Reſemblances or Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials (as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>

                     <hi>Regiſt. l.</hi> 9. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 9.</note> ſaid to <hi>Serenus</hi>) where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned People might ſee, what they could not read; but to contrive ſuch kind of Engins, wherewith Chriſtians might call in and preſentiate their Saints, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> had to call in their Gods. For Holy water, and Frankincenſe are quite extrinſecal, you know, and impertinent as to the procuring of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and likeneſs: but they may perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to making and procuring ſuch a neat and ſweet <hi>Abode,</hi> as both in the Papiſts and <hi>Pagans</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, might invite to it a great Saint. But if you will go to the practice; the common uſe made of Images ſhall tell you moſt plainly, what is the true end that they are made for. No Worſhipper goes to <hi>Lauretto,</hi> to S. <hi>Denys,</hi> to S. <hi>Michael,</hi> &amp;c. there to learn and read upon Images the Face, or the Mine of ſuch Saints: nor would he think it worth the trouble and the charges of a long Journy, to go ſo far merely to inſtruct himſelf more fully, whether our Lady hath an <hi>Aquiline</hi> Noſe; or whether S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> hath wings in his back; or S. <hi>Francis,</hi> a deep long Hood, or S. <hi>Dominic,</hi> a bald Pate: the main Motive, that drives Pilgrims to thoſe Churches, where Images are, is to find, not the Reſemblance, but the very Preſence of the Saint. So when they ſay, as they may truly, that theſe Images are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to repreſent Saints; it is in a much higher ſenſe, then when we ſay, that Pictures do repreſent Faces; for it is alſo, (and chiefly too) as when we ſay, that Embaſſadors and Nuncios repreſent Kings,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:132423:179"/>and

                  <hi>Roman</hi> Popes; and upon this account it is that if you chance to miſuſe the Image, thereby you do miſuſe the Saint as really, as they did whip <hi>Henry</hi> the great, whoſoever whipt ſtout <hi>du Perron,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting at Rome that Kings Perſon.

Thus are Images ſet up in Churches with a twofold Capacity; the one, as formal Repreſentatives to be ſerved with all the Worſhip, Praiers, Maſſes, burning Lamps, conſecrated Tapers, and Candles, and all ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Formalities, as the very Saints can be ſerved with: and the other, as Sacred Seats of their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſence and Power <hi>(Divum Numen)</hi> ſo that whenſoever you touch or pray to the Image, this muſt be don as with the ſame Devotion, ſo with the ſame hope of Relief, as if you did touch and pray perſonally and immediately to the very he or ſhe Saints themſelves: the Images in ſuch occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined,

               <p>Now, how Saints, and Images come to be ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, and concern'd one with another, is a Myſtery, that goes beyond any Chriſtian Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.

                  </note> ſtands much upon; it is becauſe they did ſet them up as Roial Marks of their Soveraignty: And if God would have thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that had bin bitten by Serpents, to look up toward the Brazen <hi>Figure</hi> of a Serpent in the Deſart; or in their public ſervices to turn their Faces towards the Ark; as now Chriſt will have Chriſtians come with reverence to his Table; it is becauſe God for certain Reaſons, Typical, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Law, had ordained thoſe Ceremonies, as now Chriſt under the Goſpel hath ordained his Sacraments. But what is all this to this <hi>Roman</hi> purpoſe? and for Gods ſake what is the connexion between Gods Saints, and <hi>Romes</hi> Images? Firſt did ever any one of Gods Saints, expreſs any deſire of being ſerved, or praied unto, after his death? Secondly, ſuppoſe this untruth, that they did? have they declared in what, and by what ſort of Repreſentatives they would be ſerved at a diſtance? Can any Papiſt ſhew, that the Virgin ever cared more for Images, then God doth, who abhors them? And ſhould we not ſuſpect thoſe Saints, if by chance were found any ſuch, who had any love for that worſhip, which in all the times of true Saints, none but Devils were pleaſed with? And if for any thing that we can certainly tell, the Saints of God are altogether ſtrangers to Images; why ſhould we think Image-worſhip to be ſo dear, and ſo Charming a Service to Saints? and therefore
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:132423:180"/>when the Maſs Biſhop praies, and believes after his Praier, that all Bleſſings may and do light on them, who bow or kneel before an Image or a Crucifix; can he not pray and believe as well, that they may and do light on them, who to the great honor of thoſe Saints either whip a Top about a Room, or drink claret in a Tavern? Since theſe laſt waies of Worſhipping, are not more deſtitute of Gods word, and Inſtitution then thoſe: and thoſe more unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and more expreſsly forbidden in all holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings then theſe. And ſo much of the firſt known Original of made and conſecrated Images.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond ſort of <hi>Roman</hi> Images, which need no Conſecration; being, as it is thought, ſufficiently conſecrated, either by the hand that made them, or by ſome other extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. Such are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Image, which Chriſt, as they ſay, made of himſelf, when King <hi>Abagarus</hi> ſent him a letter, and a Painter,

               <p n="2">2. You have another Image of the ſame worth, and of the ſame Impreſſion, which Chriſt, as they ſay, gave to <hi>Berenice,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>Veronica.</hi>

<note n="ſ" place="bottom">

For if theſe Fathers had had the leaſt hint that St. <hi>Luke</hi> had bin a Painter, and that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had bleſſed ſome
<note n="u" place="bottom">Benedict. Gonon. ſupra.</note> of his Pictures, they might have left
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:132423:181"/>abuſing and even profaning holy Scriptures, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their ſtrange Worſhip: this one Precedent of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Preaching the Goſpel one day, and the next Morning Painting Images, had bin (if true and known to be ſo) a ground more then ſufficient both to confound their Adverſaries, whom they called <hi>Breakers of Images;</hi> and to juſtifie upon ſome probability, what they offered to ſay as the Papiſts do now, upon a meer account of boldneſs, that the ancient Tradition of the Catholic Church ſtood for Images. Therefore ſince they did allege nothing of ſuch a viſible Importance for their own Cauſe, it is a Demonſtration they did not know it; and that S. <hi>Lukes</hi> skill either in Painting, or in Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, was not yet ſo much as heard of, no more then all his Images which it ſeems were kept in the dark, and as it were under the heap of thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands which durſt not appear abroad, till far worſe times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the greateſt part of thoſe Images, which now the Papiſts ſet up and adore on their Altars, ſprung and ſtarted up from under ground in the darkeſt times of the Church, like ſo many Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools and Muſhroms in a foggy Night.

St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> came many Years after thoſe two, and yet Images were to him ſo ſtrange, when ſeated in a place of Worſhip, that when by chance in his Travels he found one in a Country Church, he preſently tore it to pieces, and deſired the Biſhop of that Dioceſs to look bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuch Abuſes. St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> whom the Papiſts take for their firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Cardinal, liked ſo well both the Admonition and the Cenſure, that he put in Latin the Greek Epiſtle which contains both.

               <p>But after thoſe great Lights were out, Pictures came to be more frequent, and to be uſhered into public Places, upon this double civil account, both of being a kind of Inſtruction to Ignorants, and a conſiderable Ornament to Walls; a moſt lawful uſe certainly, as long as it could be kept harmleſs: and harmleſs alſo in it ſelf, when made uſe of in times and places, and among Men not likely to miſapply ſuch things. Images ſtood upon this foot ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years (as yet they are among the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) till the Empreſs <hi>Irene,</hi> who, after ſhe had blinded her Son (an uſual Cruelty in thoſe daies) blinded both her ſelf, and ſome hundreds of her Biſhops (the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was one of them) in a worſe and more Spiritual way. For in a great Meeting of hir Clergy, now called the ſecond <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> ſhe brought out theſe Images, from their civil Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and harmleſs uſe, to a down-right Image wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:132423:183"/>and made, as well ſhe might, moſt of her ignorant Subjects as generally Idolaters, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of other Councils, and of the Truth it ſelf, as the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had before her made them <hi>Arrians.</hi> Ever ſince thoſe daies, things grew worſe and worſe, until at laſt both Chriſtian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Churches, fall into ſuch a general and horrible Diſorder, as made moſt ſober Men to cry out, <hi>That the</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">Matth. Pariſienſis. Additam.</note> 
                  <hi>Antichrist was ſurely coming, and that the World could not laſt long.</hi> This thick Darkneſs having put out all Light and true knowledge of the Goſpel, proved to be a moſt fruitful Womb for all new upſtart Saints and Images; and the Black, Grey, and White Friers, Midwived them out ſo dexterouſly, with their Revelations and Miracles, that the Original of whole thouſands, I mean of theſe Saints and Images, is among their very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers at this day, either as unknown or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as the breeding of <hi>Romulus</hi> was, whether of a Wolf or a Whore; whether of ſeducing of Spirits, or pitifully ſeduced Monks. Only this you have for certain, as I have ſhewed by ſome Inſtances, that theſe Monks found out their Images, where the Prophet fore-tells that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhould throw their gods, among Bats, and Moles under ground: and hence pulling them up as faſt as the preſent occaſions required, out of their Holes, and, as the Crocodiles were out of the Mud, both had the ſame good luck; theſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be preferred to Temples and Churches.</p>
               <p>Now, what holy uſe and purpoſe theſe Vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Images ſtand in Chappels and Churches for, appears upon a double account. 1. Of the great
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:132423:184"/>Honor they receive. 2. And of the great Bleſſings which they are thought commonly to procure.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt account, I may the better ſpeak of the great Honors done to Images, becauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood thoſe Myſteries, as much by ſight, as by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Image, that of our Lady, for example, whether found by a poor Shepherd under a Tree, or brought and bought by a Pilgrim in the Holy Land, is ſet up over the Altar, which in their account is no leſs then the Tribunal and Throne of Chriſt. Lamps and Tapers burn before it; and if great Churches are often built from the very ground in their behalf, it is no wonder if Maſs-Prieſts, and other Officers, are kept alſo to attend their immediate Service. At your coming into the Church, the firſt Object you bow before, is the High Altar and this Image; next, if you be well diſpoſed, a Holy fear and trembling

So the <hi>Roman</hi> and ſurer way is for Worſhippers, when they come near (and for Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims at any diſtance, where firſt they can but ſee any part of the Steeple of the Church) looking up devoutly on the Image, to pour out to the Lady their Heart and Soul with a Salutation, <hi>Ave Maria, &amp;c.</hi> or with ſome other Praier, as <hi>Salve Regina, &amp;c.

As ſoon as this Sacred Image hath bin brought out with Divine Hymns and Paſchal Songs, from its Chappel into the midſt of the great Church,

                     <hi>Henr. Sedulius. de Virgine.

In the ſolemn Proceſſion, which is a conſiderable long way, the People are marſhalled into an Army. Firſt, march as it were in the Van, whole Regiments of Men and Women, girded about with the long Ropes of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> After them, other Troops follow, of Men, Women, and Children together, running both forward and backward all bare-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in Drawers, with lighted Candles in their hands: After them quite naked Bodies, loaden with Iron Armors and Chains, and in that cruel Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, crawling on their Knees moſt part of the way: Then come another Train of People, whoſe Order and Confraternity is, as the Jeſuits do teach them, to ſcourge themſelves; the very Nurſes, with their poor Babes; and old Wives, not being
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:132423:186"/>able to crawle, are carried upon little Beds, rather, then to loſe the Bleſſing that doth attend as they think, their appearing before the Image. Cloſe before it, and after theſe march both the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſinging Praiſes, and <hi>Benedicta es,</hi> &amp;c. to the Goddeſs; and other Officers with Torches. At laſt comes the Goddeſs her ſelf, being carried upon the ſhoulders of the beſt and nobleſt Virgins, which the Country can afford. Next to them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Troop of true Penitents wiſhing no more, but that the good Image may ſee their unfeigned Contrition, in their poor Members torn, as they are, and bleeding moſt pittifully, under the hard weight of their Chains. Then follow the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy; the Lieutenants, and Nobles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who bear up the conſecrate Hoſt under a brave Silk Canopy, being followed in the Rear with Multitudes of all conditions. Yet after this long Proceſſion is gone and come, the Zeal and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not over; for during eight daies and nights more, the People will run to and fro upon the Track, which they gueſs the Holy Image was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over: thus to gather up the Bleſſings, which they hope the good Lady hath ſcattered in that way. Now call you this Devotion, as you pleaſe, whether <hi>Duly,</hi> or <hi>Hyperduly,</hi> or Indirect, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, or Reflected, or Anogogical worſhip, which is beſtowed on ſuch Images; and puzle into Idolatry poor ignorant Souls, with what words and diſtinctions you think fitteſt; this worſhip is for certain ſo great, that none ſo great was ever ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſtowed on Chriſt: and if all Gods Saints ſhould appear, no greater could be beſtowed on God himſelf.</p>

               <p n="2">2. As to the other uſe of Images, which conſiſts in procuring Graces; you may be ſure that the Bleſſings, and Advantages both ſpiritual, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which the worſhipper expects from them, are at the leaſt both as numerous, and as great, as the Devotions which he beſtows. I could tell of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Images adored here and there by Papiſts, which are more regarded and truſted to, then ever was the Image of <hi>Pallas</hi> at <hi>Troy;</hi> or that of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or any one of the greateſt <hi>Pagan</hi> God any where elſe. When <hi>Turks</hi> prevail on Chriſtians, as when they infeſted <hi>Negro Pont;</hi> or if <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf be ſore diſtreſt, as when once <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> came to take it; His Holineſs <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond's beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge was to ſupplicate the Image of

                     <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 375.376.</note> he walked upon his bare feet, and carried the Image on his own Shoulders; the Covenants which had bin bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Enemies hanging upon a Croſs before it, that it or ſhe might better ſee, and upon the ſight be more ſenſible of the wrong don. So by this means, ſaies my Author, (and with the help of the French too) <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> his Forces were ſoon routed, and <hi>Romes</hi> honor and Intereſt kept ſafe.

               <p n="3">3. Now, which is the third, and the laſt, and the moſt conſiderable Point to examine; what is or may be the matter in or about all theſe Images, which can procure theſe quick Returns, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, upon all occaſions, temt men to pray and worſhip them, is more then the Roman worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers can or dare diſtinctly tell.</p>
               <p>All that you find in an Image, muſt come to ſome of theſe three Things. 1. The ſubſtance that it is made off. 2. The outward
<note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de Imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>ſect. Quarto, in</hi>
                  </note> Shape or Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, that makes it in mens conceit the Image of ſuch an Angel, or ſuch a Saint. 3. The Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that makes it a holy Image.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, the matter or ſubſtance it ſelf, to wit Marble, Braſs, or Silver, &amp;c. can do no more, then to make the Image more or leſs fine, rich and coſtly: and tho it were a Saint <hi>Christopher</hi> (that is a huge great ſtatue, like a Giant, which ſtands in moſt of their Churches) of Maſſy Gold;
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:132423:188"/>it might draw men to admire the Price, but not the vertue of the Image. For when Images are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, it is not as in the caſe of Maſs-wafers, which in five words are preſently tranſubſtantiated from what they were; the Marble or Braſs or any ſubſtance whatſoever remains ſtill the ſame: and thus far Pagans and Papiſts may be equally credited, when, whatſoever their worſhipping be, they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly diſown Gold, Wood or Stone, for being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Saints, or their Gods.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſiderable thing in an Image, is the outward form and figure intended to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent either among the Pagans a God, or among the Papiſts a Saint. Upon this Point, tho Roman I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages were ſo ancient and ſo happy as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly acknowledged for Pictures of <hi>S. Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or <hi>S. Luke,</hi> or a very Angels drawing: and tho they ſhould moſt truly repreſent the Bleſſed Virgins-Face and Features; the utmoſt they could temt men to by this moſt exact Reſemblance, were perhaps to go a good way purpoſely to ſee and view them: yet no ſober men on ſuch accounts could be temted to worſhip them, much leſs to hope any great matter, from having ſeen and worſhipt them. Figures, Shapes, and Proportions which make I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages like, or unlike, are of themſelves, you know as uneffectual and unactive on other ſcores, as bare words, Cyphers, or letters are: and therefore the Reſemblances which reſult from them, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no effect at all, but, as ſacred or profane ſigns may, by ſome either Divine, or human Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Thus once the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might well hope to keep off the Deſtroier, by ſprinkling their Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels with Blood; or to recover their former health,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:132423:189"/>by looking up toward the Serpent, becauſe God had inſtituted theſe two ſigns, and had promiſed ſuch Bleſſings, if the People did uſe them ſo. Thus the ſubjects of the ancient Roman Empire might hope, beſides the performance of their Duty, to get the favor of their Princes, by ſtanding about their Statues, or by their low and civil kneeling, when their firſt Miniſters (as once <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Mordecai</hi> under <hi>Aſſuerus</hi>) chance to paſs by; becauſe theſe Soveraigns had reſolved and declared, it ſhould be ſo: and becauſe it is in their power, as to challenge their Peoples Duty, ſo to diſpenſe their own Favors, at any time, at any Place, and at any mark, ſign, or token, which they will chuſe. For tho great Kings cannot appear in their own perſons every where; yet will they ſome other way appear as Soveraigns, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo every where: and if any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or any unruly Multitude take down what they were pleaſed to ſet up as the Enſigns of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or of their declared Pleſure (as they did, who pulled down the Statue of <hi>Eudocia,</hi> which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>

               <p>Now to bring all this home to the Caſe; 1. Who knows that Roman Images, are either drawn by a Saint, whom no Scripture ſaies, to have bin a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, rather then by <hi>Pilate,</hi> or by <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who perhaps

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:132423:189"/>ſuch as they are now repreſented, ſhe with a delicate Italian Face; he with the Corpulency of a Dutch Boy? 2. When there is little to ſatisfie a curious Eie, is there more for a pious heart? what Sacred Inſtitution of either Chriſt, or his Apoſtles about Images can either give ground to a due lawful wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or ſupply the expected Bleſſings, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape, nor likeneſs can? Did ever any one of Gods Saints intimate ſome where in their lives, that they would take it very kindly, if they were praied to before Images? and did ever the Virgin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to any Body, that ſhe would either come, or ſend to ſave Towns and Countries from plagues and wars, when ever they would ſet up her Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? whether of the two waies is more likely, to bring her to what we deſire; the carrying her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures about, or as it hath bin ſucceſsfully don ſometimes, the plain

If both ſupplicating and threatening be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like uncommanded, and impertinent for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; is the looking toward the Ark, or the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Brazen Serpent, which had both a Commandment and a Promiſe, ſo fit a Precedent, as they
<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de Imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> pretend, to countenance praying or looking to Images, which for certain had neither of theſe? Therefore ſince neither the Matter, nor the external Form of Images have any ſtrength, either themſelves or of any known help conferr'd by God,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:132423:190"/>to enable them towards any manner of work; let us ſee what the conſecrating of this Matter and Form can do. For if this laſt can do little, or nothing in order to thoſe great and extraordinary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are attributed to Roman Images, you muſt needs ſeek farther for ſome other both as great and extraordinary Principles.</p>
               <p>The Conſecrating of Images, as the Roman Church practiſes it, may be conſidered either as a Praier, or as an ordinary, or extraordinary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If you take it as a Praier; 1. What Ground of faith have they for venturing upon ſuch Praiers? and what Promiſe, Precept or Precedent for Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Images, in hope of being afterwards bleſſed by them? 2. With what Chriſtian and ſober modeſty, can they wiſh and deviſe Inſtruments, which no holy man, or Scripture ever thought of, to put both God upon hearing, or his Saints upon media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and promoting, what we ſhall pray for, before Images? 3. And as to more ſpecial Bleſſings, which are lookt for at the devout uſing of theſe Engines; what ſilly fancy is this to call upon God, for making wood, ſtone or any other materials that Images are commonly made of, after they have ſhaped it after their own way, happy and powerful Inſtruments to keep houſes and Vineyards; to keep off Hail and Devils; to give women an eaſie labor; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure good Husbands to Maidens; or to kill them who are not ſo? For I am ſure many Images are renowned and ſought after for ſuch Bleſſings. 4. But what horrible Boldneſs is this to conjure God in theſe conſecrating Praiers thro his holy Names and Titles in behalf of ſuch ſtrange Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo far againſt the ordinary Courſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:132423:190"/>and farther beyond his Promiſes? And what Returns can they expect of ſuch faithleſs ſinful Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but Vanity? and if ſomething elſe, but Gods wrath and their own Confuſion?</p>
               <p>If you take this Conſecration, as a Power; I pray, when and where appears it, that God ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed this Power either on his, or the Popes Church? Chriſt in the firſt times of the Church inveſted both his Apoſtles, and other Servants with many great and extraordinary Gifts, for caſting out Devils, for curing all ſorts of Diſeaſes, for removing even Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; but where, either for enabling Images, or for the doing either good or harm with Images? They beſtowed the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and as it were of courſe upon Believers at their Baptiſm; but when and where upon Marbles, or curiouſly wrought Pieces of Timber at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration? Where and when did they conſecrate Pictures, to ſink Ships, to rout Armies, to raiſe ſtorms, and thunders, and Hails, as Roman Images will do ſometimes? When the bleſſed Apoſtles, with the laying on of their hands, could endue other men beſides themſelves with miraculous Power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, in order to propheſying, and ſpeaking My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in ſtrange Languages; did they endue carved ſtones alſo, with power to ſpeak, and to play, to ſing or weep, and to do all thoſe handſom Feats which are ſaid of Roman Images? Did ever S. <hi>Peter</hi> leave this Power with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or the Pope, or any conſecrating Biſhop, that on what ſtatue or Picture ſoever he ſhould lay his hand, and ſprinkle water, and pour Oil, and burn Frankincenſe, it ſhould be forthwith elevated to high and mighty Performances? If <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had this Power,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:132423:191"/>and left it to ſucceſſion; God, and his Saints muſt look to it: for as Chriſt is at every turn liable by Conſecration to be ſhut up in a Maſs wafer, God and his Saints are not quite free from conſecrated Shapes and Images. For the Conſecration, as a Power, obliges God in a conſiderable manner to hear and report to his Saints, whatſoever is praied for at their Images: and ties as conſiderably the Saints, to ſollicite and intercede with God, for the Requeſt which he reports; and often to come down themſelves, to execute and diſpatch it. God is bound I ſay by this conſecrating Power which he is ſuppoſed to grant, both he to hear and to report what is ſaid before the Image; for otherwiſe, how could the Saints concerned in the Caſe underſtand it? and what were the Power good for? And the Saint is put to ſo much trouble; For beſides the trouble of ſolliciting the buſineſs, which they underſtand they are praied for, at their conſecated Images; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ramblings to and fro are they in equity obliged to, (unleſs all their Apparitions, and Activities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Images be mere Lies) either to hear it the ſooner, or to give it a quicker diſpatch? And who knows not that Roman Images, and Roman Saints, (in famous Churches eſpecially) are never or ſeldom aſunder? I call to witneſs all the long and holy Pilgrimages undertaken upon this ſcore, to <hi>Lauretta,</hi> to <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> to <hi>S. Michael,</hi> &amp;c. there purpoſely to meet either with the reſpective Saints, or their aſſiſting Vertue, <hi>Divorum &amp; Divarum Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that is the Godhead of the He or She Saint, which is ſuppoſed to watch ſomewhere, in, or about his dear Image. I call to witneſs the many Vows, which are directed from all parts to theſe ſaid Saints,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:132423:191"/>not in Heaven, their proper Abode, as one ſhould think; but to the Lady at <hi>Lauretta,</hi> or <hi>Montaigue,</hi> or to the good Saint at <hi>Padua, Ardilliers, Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardia,</hi> &amp;c. there helping men and women by their Images, in ſuch Churches. And it is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that both theſe Images, and Churches are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated with the greateſt Pomp; waſht with the beſt ſort of Holy water; made ſweet with the choiceſt Perfumes; lighted day and night, with the cleareſt Lamps and Candles; dreſſed with the coſtlieſt Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and Laces; ſerved with the Curiouſeſt Muſic; the Images ſpecially ſeated on the Eminenteſt Places of the Church, and (what would you have more) honor'd with the compleateſt Maſs, to invite thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Heaven theſe Holy gueſts. And let <hi>Rome</hi> ſearch out her Vatican, and try whether in all Antiquity ſhe can find an honeſt Example for ſuch Conſecrations and Attractives, but either among old heatheniſh Prieſts, or among old and new <hi>Sorcerers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, tho by this which I have ſaid, it appears clearly enough, that the Matter, the Form, the Likeneſs, the Power of Conſecration, or any thing elſe, which you can find intrinſecal to an Image, is both uneffectual, and unchriſtian, both as to make it a fit Object for any Religious ſervice, or to make it a ſufficient Cauſe of any wonderful Bleſſing; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is found by experience, and however it is moſt certain in the common Apprehenſion of Roman Catholics, that a very great number of Images by being conſecrated and worſhipped, have attained to ſuch a great degree and improvement of ſtrength and Action above what either they are in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or can be raiſed to by Art, that it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all Chriſtians, ſeriouſly to inquire into the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:132423:192"/>hidden Cauſes and Principles of ſuch Extraordinary Atchievements. For my part I do not believe, (and many Papiſts do not) that all and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing commonly reported of theſe Roman Images, is true; and, of the other ſide, I do not believe that all is falſe. However, if all were falſe, they ſhould do well to burn out of their Church their great Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical, Ceremonial, and Miſſal Books: and to throw away their Images back again into the ſame Holes, whence they were pleaſed to dig them out. But if any part of what they ſay concerning them be true; I make no queſtion it will prove worſe then if it were falſe: and to make it good I require only the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient attention of an underſtanding, and unprepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reader.</p>
               <p>Not to make <hi>Pagans,</hi> or Papiſts in any degree worſe then they are; both diſown in the conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Images all ſuch
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cellus ap.

<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bellar. de Imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> make theſe worſe then they are, that they may ſeem worſe then themſelves. But that within, neer, or about the Roman or Pagan Images either by conſecrating, or worſhipping them, are imported ſuch Additionals of either inherent, or wonderful aſſiſting vertues, as may both help out worſhippers, and well deſerve Adoration and Service; is an Article of Heatheniſh Faith, which the Pagans publicly declare: and which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:132423:192"/>the Papiſts do as really preſuppoſe in all their practice and Hiſtories: nor can in truth, without belying both their Devotions and Conſciences plainly deny, however they think it more convenient to mince and palliate it for mere ſhame. This is the down-right Confeſſion of the Heatheniſh Philoſophers. <hi>You muſt not wonder</hi> (ſaies

                  <hi>that have redeemed us: it is you that have reconciled us with God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. Juſt as the curſed Idolater in the Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.9. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 2.15. praies to the Wood, <hi>Rowſe now thy ſelf and reſcue me.</hi> There both the Devil and his Idol, and there the Saint and his Image are hudled up in the ſame Adoration. And as when the Hoſt is carried along, all that ſee the Maſs-Prieſt at any diſtance, fall on their knees; and if they hear only the little Bell, they cry, <hi>There is the good God, who paſſes by:</hi> whoſoever goes to, or comes from a Church, ſaies, Either I will go and pray, or now I come from viſiting and praying to our good Lady: becauſe as he really believes that there the Maſs-Wafer is, by Tranſubſtantiation, become the Lord; ſo he believes, that the Image which he hath ſeen, is either by Conſubſtantiation, Inhabitation, or ſome other aſſiſting mode, become to him the good Lady. And I defie all the <hi>Roman</hi> Preachers to ſay any thing to juſtifie what they do upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which the Pagans may not ſay as well or better for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Leſt you ſhould think, that Wood and Stone are thus adored, ſpoken, and praied to, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mere account of Reſemblance; (in which caſe, any one of our Ladies Pictures might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored and praied to as well at a Painters, as in a Church) is is generally done upon the Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:132423:193"/>of an incloſed, or at leaſt aſſiſting Vertue. It is this ſtrong perſwaſion that makes a Catholic Worſhipper creep reverently and trembling to our Lady, to get a touch for the little Image, which he hath newly bought of a Shop: and all Men know how much the better their Beads will ſell, when the Pedler can ſtoutly ſwear that they have touched ſuch a Saint, that is, his Image. By this it doth appear evidently, that the Image is conceived by them to have ſome prime Vertue in it ſelf, ſince it imparts it to another: and I would know, who of them all dares ſay any of thoſe Images, which he dares not ſcarce look in the Face, that it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides reſemblance, nothing more then another ſtone. They that go to touch the Chin, or the Toe, or ſome other Bone of a Saint, think it endued with ſome vertue, above that of ordinary Bones, becauſe it was, and is ſtill the part of a Holy Body. They who go a long Pilgrimage to rub their Clothes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Shift of our Lady, or their Stockings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Breeches of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> muſt think that the warmth of their holy Fleſh have left in them ſome hidden Bleſſing, which they do hope may be in ſome meſure communicated to other things. Ask the Papiſts, why that Image which they do call <hi>Veronica,</hi> ſhould have ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vertues; they will tell you, that Chriſt made it himſelf; and that beſides this, he made it of the Sweat and Blood in his Face. But what have other Images in their carved pieces of Wood, which may temt ſober Men to ſeek after, to touch, to kiſs, in hope of being Bleſſed by ſuch Embraces, unleſs it be the aſſiſting, or inhabitation, or ſome other like commerce of Holy Powers, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:132423:194"/>call <hi>Numina,</hi> which are either therein, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you will have more convincing Proofs, go for example, to the Image of our Lady in Mount <hi>Gardia</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bened. Gononus Chron. an.</hi> 1433.</note>, which keeps Whores off, and perfumes all that comes near it, with a moſt Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Fragrancy: or to another Image of hers, once adored in <hi>Sozopolis,</hi> which

                     <hi>Bozius de Sig. Eccleſ. t.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> ſweats out of its hand a kind of Oil, to cure them who are anointed with it. Go to a third Image of hers
<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Baron. an.</hi> 446. <hi>n.</hi> 16.</note>, which, when hidden and unſeen, diſcovers it ſelf by its own light. Juſt ſuch another you have in <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ant. Yepes. Ord. S. Bened. an.</hi> 574.</note>, which was perceived in the ſame manner ſhining under the root of an old Oak. But nothing can be brought more demonſtrative to this purpoſe, then the Image of <hi>Bardenarda:</hi> it had bin bought by a Pilgrim at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> out of a Shop, conſecrated, when, and where, or whether at all, I cannot tell: However, after much ſervice and adoration, the Image it ſelf,
<note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Baronius. An.</hi> 87. <hi>n.</hi> 63.</note> from a coloured Board at the Painters, is grown Fleſhy in its Chappel; its Breaſt from being flat, is ſwelled perfectly into the Figure of two Paps, whence flows ſuch odoriferous Oil, as no Balſam is like it; and ſo Miraculous withal, that it cures all ſorts of Diſeaſes. This, however it comes to paſs, is Intrinſecal and Inherent in the Image, and may draw Pilgrims to worſhip it, without the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of its Saint. And the truth is, it is ſo Holy
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:132423:194"/>by its ſelf, if you believe <hi>Baronius,</hi> that no Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper dares touch it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What will you ſay to ſuch Images as have an inviſible Faculty within themſelves, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crawling or flying back- to that place which they like better, in caſe you offer to remove them? And ſuch are the moſt part of them, which now a daies are reported to work Miracles. Such is that of <hi>Montegardia</hi> for example,
<note n="o" place="bottom">Bened. Gonon. ſupra.</note> which fled away out of the Ship, when Thieves thought to carry it to <hi>Venice.</hi> Such is that other of <hi>Rachietta</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> which being
<note n="p" place="bottom">Hieraſc. in vita Sylv</note> removed from whence it was, into a very handſom Chappel, was found the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its old Room. Such is that of the <hi>Servites,</hi> near <hi>Lamo</hi>

                     <hi>Chronic. Deip. an</hi> 1492.</note>, which made nothing to jump from one ſide of the River to the other. And to inſiſt upon no more, ſuch is that famous one of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta,</hi> which
<note n="r" place="bottom">Turſelin. Lauret. Hiſt.</note> being diſpleaſed (at leaſt the Saint dwelling therein) that it was not more regarded in its Country at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> tranſported it ſelf, with Houſe and all, to <hi>Italy,</hi> where now it is ſerved to ſome purpoſe.</p>

Theſe, and five hundred more Images, which I could produce, if need were, are the uſual Oracles of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ordinary Seats of <hi>Roman</hi> Saints: and when <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> with ſome others ſay, that they do honor theſe Images as ſigns only repreſenting, and and not as Seats and Inſtruments inhabited or aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inviſible Spirit of their Saints; they are confuted by theſe two waies, the viſible Practice of their Church, and the inviſible Teſtimony of their own private Conſciences.</p>
               <p>What might be ſaid more probably both in behalf of theſe Images, and of their zealous Devotion in worſhipping them, is what frees them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which Holy Scripture caſts on Idols; that they have Eies, and ſee withal; they have Hands, wherewith they handle, and ſomtimes give terrible blows: if they have Mouths, it is not in vain, ſince they can cry, and laugh, and ſpeak, and ſomtimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Propheſie: Feet have they, and thereon leap, and walk, and flee: and if they have Noſes, they ſmell therewith, and can tell where the wanton and the wicked Perſons are: All this, I ſay, from their own approved Authors. Only the main difficulty remains (and I conjure all ſober Men, as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Salvation, to look how to ſatisfie it well)
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:132423:196"/>to know what is the inward Principle, Spirit, or Soul, which moves and animates theſe dead Figures, to all and more then what living Bodies can perform with the help of their living Souls. Here let the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics well conſider, whether to juſtifie them by theſe acts of activity from being Idols, doth not by the ſame means both accuſe and convince them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devils.</p>
               <p>The Holy Scripture warns Men often againſt falſe Chriſts, and, falſe Prophets, againſt falſe Apoſtles and falſe Spirits: it were ſtrange, if we had no need of warning, or of being wary againſt falſe Saints. I find ſomtimes the beſt <hi>Roman</hi> Monks much puzled, what to think of their moſt celebrated Apparitions: and tho they truſt too much their Holy Water (a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful trial God knows) in the diſcernment of the good from the bad Spirits, yet they do not think it unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic to demur ſomtimes in ſuch matters. It is neither want of Learning, nor want of Faith in the School-men, the Primitive Fathers of Popery, which makes them diſpute now and then, whether that which they ſee at Maſs under the Figure of raw Fleſh, or a young Child, be Chriſt himſelf, or a <hi>Phantome:</hi> and certainly, we have no ground either in Scripture, or in Reaſon, or in Experience to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us, but that the Devils, which play ſuch pranks both in Apparitions, and on Altars, may jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle as well, and play worſe tricks about conſecrated Images.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is no ſmall prejudice againſt theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Images, and the <hi>Roman</hi> way of uſing them, that both came ſo late into the Church: and that in the beſt Primitive Times, when the Church was a purer Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, none but Heretics had Images; whereas in theſe
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:132423:197"/>later and worſe Ages, when the Church is confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſe too, no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics are without them. It is alſo no ſmall prejudice againſt the beſt, as it is ſuppoſed, and the moſt famous of theſe Images, that when they were admitted at firſt, as either viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, or as Ornaments of new Walls, not one of them did work Miracles; or if it did, 'twas in behalf of Infidels and Pagans only, as it is preſuppoſed by Patriarch <hi>Tharaſius</hi>

Is it becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and the Heretics then, and the Maſs-Prieſts and Papiſts now underſtand the worth of Images, and the right uſe of Image-worſhip, better then the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did? Or is it becauſe the Holy Apoſtles had neither Patriarchs, nor Prophets, nor Martyrs, to make Saints of, or to conſecrate Images to? Is it not more probable to think, that this Alteration hath thus happened, becauſe both Pagans and Papiſts are of the ſame mind as to Images? And becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which Chriſt and his Bleſſed Apoſtles had ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced and beaten off from moſt of their Pagan Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having long wandered among the Heathen, and in dry places, have at laſt found better ſhelter and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment at <hi>Lauretta, Montſerat,</hi> and other great <hi>Roman</hi> Oracles? What can one think elſe of Images, which having kept themſelves cloſe, dumb and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:132423:197"/>in the beſt and Primitive daies, take now their advantage to ſtart up, and to make a noiſe, and to ſhew Miracles in theſe later times of the Church, when both by Chriſt and his Apoſtles Predictions, and the Judgment

               <p>Secondly, That which aggravates the ſuſpition of appearing in unhappy Times, like the coming of Thieves and unexpected Straglers in dark Nights, is the ugly and pitiful Holes where moſt of theſe Images were at firſt found. For theſe Images (I mean thoſe wonderful and famous ones which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church runs moſt after) were neither lately made by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Painters, nor conſecrated by ordinary <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops: they are ſuppoſed to have bin made and conſecrated by no meaner Workmen then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Chriſt, his Angels, and ſuch of his Saints; as <hi>S. Luke, S. Nicodemus, &amp;c.</hi> were, and ſo left and depoſited to the Chriſtian Church, and Catholic Tradition. Hereupon let me ask two things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for any ſober ſatisfaction. The firſt, When and where, if ever at all, theſe Saints made theſe Images; and by laying on of their Hands, or otherwiſe, conferred on them the Gifts of Speaking, of Prophecying, and working Miracles; or put in them an inward or aſſiſting Spirit, to make them ſpeak, foretel, and do ſtrange things? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, When and where having uſed them, as it is ſuppoſed they have, they thought fit to bury them under Ground, and to hide ſome among Thorns, ſome under Brambles, all in moſt pitiful places; as dark Holes, and hollow Trees, where they were
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:132423:198"/>found, and where any wiſe Man would rather look for Worms or Toads? If you ſay they hid them in thoſe places, for fear of the Pagan Perſecuters; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans were not haters at all, nor deſtroiers of Images; contrariwiſe, they loved Images, as Papiſts do. But ſince they were great Burners and Deſtroiers of Holy Scriptures: Why would the Apoſtolical Men rather hide their Books under ground, which were moſt principally both hated and ſought after, then their Images, which were not ſo? And if they hid both Images and Books together, by what univerſal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance did they never find any of theſe, where they found thoſe? How came the Holy Scriptures to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves ſo ſoon, ever in cruelleſt times of the Primitive Perſecutions; and <hi>Roman</hi> Images ſo late, and ſo many hundred Years after all theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions were over? Why did not Images howl or ſing under their Nettles as well in the fourth and fifth Age, when <hi>S. Epiphanius, S. Jerome, S. Chryſoſtom,</hi> and ſuch Learned Fathers might have beſt judged of their worth, as they did many hundred Years after, when Antichriſt was expected, and when all the Learning and Holineſs of the Goſpel was under the thickeſt Cloud? If you go to Tradition, which, is what the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and now the Papiſts go too: as if <hi>Roman</hi> Images were come from hand to hand immediatly from the Apoſtles: By what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune comes it to paſs, that the many hundreds of Greek Prelats, all great Admirers of Images, and Boaſters of Tradition, had never one of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Pictures, nor of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> nor of Chriſt, and that now <hi>Rome</hi> hath got them all? But ſince theſe Images never came to us through their hands, as it is certain they came not that way, <hi>Rome</hi> hath got them, either
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:132423:198"/>flying like Birds and Fowls over their Heads, or creeping along ſilently like Moles and Vermin under their Feet. The truth is, when this ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> was held, it was ſomwhat too ſoon for ſuch <hi>Roman</hi> Novelties, as the prating and howling of Images, to appear above Chriſtian Ground; it was not then yet quite ſo dark, but the Church could ſee about her, altho it was toward Sun-ſetting: Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlings venture not to dance at any Light, but the Moon-ſhine. A deep Mid-night of Ignorance, and of all other Confuſions beſides, which ſoon after over-whelmed the following Ages, was by much a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time for Stones and Images to ſpeak, and for Spirits to delude Men. And you may judg what Ghoſts they are, who hide their Heads during the times of the Apoſtles, and all the Primitive Fathers, and take their times to ſhew them, when all is full of new Revelations, and Dreams, and Monks; and yet ſhew themſelves in ſuch a manner, as marks both their Original and their Nature, appearing forth from under ground, and watching under Buſhes and Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, like thoſe Spirits in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.4. which were not heard, but muttering out of the duſt. Certainly, thoſe bleſſed Spirits who are imagined to ſpeak thus, are not in Hell, whence damned Souls in <hi>Romes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will ſomtimes howl: nor in that other place, which in their Opinion, is about it, and which they call Purgatory, whence they ſay that tortured Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will come up to bemoan themſelves; they have a moſt happy and glorious abode in Heaven, whence it is not imaginable they will come down, unleſs thruſt out, to lurk and weep here under Hedges. The Scripture ſpeaks of ſome falſe Gods, which, you may be ſure of it, were true Devils, who loved to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:132423:199"/>be courted under green Trees; and of ſome other wicked Spirits, which either whiſper with a low voice, as from the Earth, or are met with and ſpoken to in ſome Sepulcher, and love to keep themſelves and others in Wilderneſſes, and about Tombs. The Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had familiar Spirits, or Demons, <hi>Dii Lares,</hi> and <hi>Dii Penates,</hi> which watch'd and fluttered about their Hearths and Houſes. I have heard of ſome who had travelled in the Eaſt, that in thoſe vaſt Deſarts between the Holy Land and the Red Sea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially about Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> there are many unhappy <hi>Phantomes,</hi> that will watch and kill Men ſomtimes, when they find them ſingle, and ſtragling from their Convoies or <hi>Caravans.</hi> And I am ſatisfied by ſome noble and living Eye-witneſſes, that often in ſome Silver Mines, as for example, near <hi>Befort</hi> in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> are ſeen a ſort of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little Men, in red or blue Juppa's, <hi>Genii Metallici,</hi> playing and trifling about Work-men, eſpecially in the deepeſt Holes. Theſe are both fit and likely Juglers, to act their part in hollow Trees and dark Corners: But who could expect it of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> or of any Glorious and Bleſſed Saints or Angels, that inſtead of waiting upon Chriſt in their Robes, about his Throne (or if need be, as at his Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the <hi>glorious Mount</hi>) they would come down into baſe Holes, and there become Pupet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiers, to make Images whiſtle under Nettles? Let <hi>Rome</hi> find us one ſuch Example, and ſecond it with ſome reaſon why the Bleſſed Saints and Angels, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever appear in Holy Scriptures, deteſt and wave A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration for themſelves; and now a daies under Popery come down purpoſely to crave and beg it, for their Images.</p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:132423:199"/>

And the truth is, if holy Souls may be allowed in that elevated condition wherein they live, to fancy yet dead and groſs things; it were rather their Bones and Relics, wherewith they have fought the good Fight, then carved Wood, and painted Boards, wherewith they never had any commerce. For, as to Pieces of ſtone or wood, which are nothing to their Nature, and as little to their Happineſs; it were moſt ſtrange, to ſee them taken with ſuch Things, and upon ſuch poor ſilly accounts, becauſe therein forſooth they ſee ſomewhat like either their Form, or their Faces.

If theſe, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more like Stories be true, as Catholics believe they are, Whether is it a Saint or a Devil, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroies Gods living Image, to ſave dead Stones and Stocks from any ſhew of Injury? And is this the Mother of Mercy, or not rather one of thoſe ſworn haters of Men, that love alike both the deſtruction of Men, and the preſervation of Images? Take the Images at their beſt ſide, the Bleſſed Saints are more earneſt and ſerious, then to be taken with ſuch Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; and if you take them at the worſt, the Bleſſed Saints are more holy, then to be ſuch zealous Hectors in the defence of what God hates.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:132423:201"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Another ſhrewd Evidence to prove, that ſuch ſeeming Saints are real Devils, is the Magical Sympathy and uſual Correſpondency, that binds them and their Images together; and this is what Image-worſhip is come to. The firſt Chriſtians had neither Image-worſhip, nor Images. Afterwards, about the Year 600, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt would have Images,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Regiſt. l.</hi> 9. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 9.</note> But no worſhip; and thus they ſtood awhile only as Ornaments to Walls, and as a kind of Book to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant People. About ſome 200 Years after, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> by the Forwardneſs of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> (a bold Gazetteer of old Tales, as I can prove whenſoever I will) and by the blind Zeal of <hi>Irene</hi> (a cruel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her own Son, and more cruel to Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) Worſhip was faſtened upon Images: and both were in a Council pack'd up, as the Empreſs pleaſed, and regulated to theſe terms, that the honor or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor done to the Images, ſhould redound upon the Saint; and that Saints might be conceived to have ſuch a moral Being, or civil Capacity in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as Princes have in their Ambaſſadors, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men in their Proxies. Hitherto the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors dare not own or advance more then this, in their Diſputations and Schools. But alas, in their Practiſes, and in their Sermons, and devout Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Hiſtories, the true Food of their <hi>Roman</hi> People, this Moral Capacity is grown into a true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inexiſtency or Conjunction, both of the Saint acting and doing all in his Image, and of the Image, as a ſubſervient Inſtrument, or beloved Seat to the Saint. And from hence comes the true fellow-feeling and mutual Sympathy between <hi>Roman Images</hi> and <hi>Roman Saints,</hi> ſuch as have bin alwaies obſerved to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:132423:201"/>be between <hi>Pagan Idols</hi> and <hi>Pagan Gods.</hi> For proof whereof you may obſerve, 1. That when the <hi>Roman</hi> Saint is either hardly uſed, or hard at work, his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſuffers the Symptoms of it. Thus, if the Lady be in great diſtreſs, as they ſay, that ſhe was once, to ſee her Son ready to deſtroy all Man-kind,
<note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chronic. Deip. an.</hi> 1160.</note> and her ſelf ſcarce able to hold him, her dear Image was ſeen ſweating. If ſhe is terribly provoked, as once ſhe was againſt a Preacher, who ſaid, that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Sin; her Image, tho made of cold Marble, will be ſenſible of that affront,
<note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. an.</hi> 1460.</note> and with a fierce and angry look, turn its back to him when he paſſes. If ſhe have a mind to a certain Day, as when ſhe would chuſe the Saturday in every Week, her
<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. an.</hi> 770.</note> Image will correſpond to her ſecret Intention, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that day put off its Veil, that all the World may thereby know, that both the Saint and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage have a deſire to be then ſeen. On the other ſide, the Saint is neither unthankful, nor backward in returning with advantage all good Offices to his (or her) Images, not only by countenancing them, for that he or ſhe doth moſt zealouſly; but alſo in any way that may beſpeak a ſtrict Partnerſhip, and friendly mutual Intelligence. For example, if one will be wedded to the Roman Lady, let him but do
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rob. Rich. in vita S. Edmund. c.</hi> 6.</note> as <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did, take any Ring, and with that intention put it upon her Images Finger, ſhe will wear the ſame on her own, and accept him for her Husband. If you will well ſecure your Town againſt Wars and Invaſions, truſt her ſweet Image with the Keies, and you ſhall ſee, by what ſhe did
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:132423:202"/>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. ſupra.</note> once at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and at <hi>Tournay,</hi> how ſhe will lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily beſtir her ſelf to make good the Truſt. If the Image be hurt or maimed, the Saint commonly lends it ſome Blood to bleed, that Men may ſee, that tis not a Stone that they ſtrike at, but a Body which is (or ſome other for it) ſenſible. Sometimes the Saint will take on himſelf the very Marks of all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which have bin offered to his Image: as when a Jew had bin ſo impious, as to ſtrike one full in the Face, and then being troubled to ſee it bleed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that fear hiding himſelf, the next day
<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mag. Specul. Tit. Ira ego.

This one inſtance (and many more that might be had to this purpoſe) doth plainly ſhew, that <hi>Roman</hi> Saints concern themſelves in their Images, not in a civil regard only, as Kings abuſed in their Envoies, or Nobles beheaded in their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or Effigies; but in a far more real manner, as if Catholic Kings did find their Backs excoriated, when ſome Pope ſcourges their Ambaſſadors; and, as if Gentlemen had their Heads really cut off from their ſhoulders, when the Hang-man ſtrikes their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. There is ſuch an effectual Correſpondency between <hi>Roman</hi> Saints and Images, as is obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Twins, who moſt commonly are either well or ill together: or to come ſomewhat nearer the caſe, as between enchanted Images of Wax, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:132423:202"/>intended by them, who freez, or burn according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Magician manages the buſineſs. After this rate, as they ſpeak

                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:132423:203"/>whom theſe Images do relate to.

                  <hi>Tournay,</hi> for an old Image: and ſo upon this whole matter, judg whether <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods and <hi>Roman</hi> Saints be not alike, as to their care and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Images; and how unreaſonable it were, if you take thoſe for very Devils, to take theſe for any true Saints.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The very acts of making Images to ſpeak, is an irrefragable Evidence of their being both ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and unſaint-like Spirits. God, and his Bleſſed Angels, have in times paſt expreſſed themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies by Viſions, Dreams, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> Signs, Judgments, Fires, and Thunders. I leave out Gods ſpeaking by Men, becauſe it is his moſt ordinary way of Revelation. But let the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics turn over either the Holy Scripture, or the genuine Writings of any ancient Father; and then ſhew me, where ever God, or Saints, or Angels ſpake either in the Church, or abroad in the World,
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Balinghem.</hi> 28. <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:132423:203"/>by Stocks or Stones, or any kind of dead Pictures; and after they have conſulted their Conſciences, if inſtructed with any degree of Learning, let them pronounce, whether both ſpeaking and working through Images, be or be not the moſt univerſal and moſt conſtant way of Devils. Hereupon let <hi>Rome</hi> conſider, that tho Devils may and do often coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance themſelves with counterfeiting the waies of of God, God or his Saints never have diſparaged themſelves with uſing the waies of Devils; much leſs ſuch a way as the uſe of Images is, which God hath ſo earneſtly and conſtantly diſowned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf againſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Their own Speeches and Actings may convince any ſober Man, by their own Ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Impiety, what kind of Spirits ſet them on work. To be ſhort, conſider but this one inſtance, namely, the Image of our good Lady, with a young Child on her left arm, the great Goddeſs and God of <hi>Rome;</hi> and at the firſt entring into a <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the firſt and moſt conſpicuous Object of the <hi>Roman</hi> Adoration. Conſider in this double Image. 1. The <hi>Roman</hi> Lady. 2. The <hi>Roman,</hi> or as they call it, the ſweet Baby, each by themſelves. 3. Both the Mother and the Babe together.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the main and Mother Image: What is it, do you think, that makes Images ſometimes as light as any Feather; ſometimes as heavy and immovable as any Rock; ſometimes to fly; ſometimes to dance; ſometimes to ſing; ſometimes to weep; ſometimes to ſweat; ſometimes to tear themſelves to pieces? For if all the Pranks be true, as 'tis certain they are poſſible, do they not become ſomewhat better thoſe wild ſilly Spirits, that uſe to tumble ſtools and diſhes,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:132423:204"/>or to skip up and down in a houſe; then the moſt Holy, the moſt ſerious, and the moſt truly glorified Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> Whoſoever will be at the trouble of ſumming up the Hours and Daies, which ſince theſe ſix or ſeven hundred years have bin miſpent about ſuch doings, ſhall find, both that this ſpirit (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is) that animates this <hi>Roman</hi> Image, is oftner below, then above; and that againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all true glorified Saints, he or ſhe fidles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more of his time about Viſions, and Drudgeries, about Gallows, Whores, and Priſons, and about <hi>Monks,</hi> and their Images, then is left him or her to ſpend with the Bleſſed Saints about Gods Throne, and in the Beatifical Viſion.</p>
               <p>Seeondly, what do you think of thoſe Spirits, which help Images to be Nurſes: and which ſo preſs their Breaſts with their hands, that as much Milk ſhall run out thence, as an ordinary Child can well drink? They ſay that <hi>Abbot Bernard</hi> hath twice or thrice ſuckt of this Milk: and that it did ſweeten his Tongue into pleſant Eloquence, wherewith he praiſed the Holy Virgin.
<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bened. Gonon. Chronic. an.</hi> 1152.</note> This ſtory is true, or all are falſe; for it is reported by ſo many, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſo many more, that it were folly to doubt of it, unleſs one reſolves to doubt of all. But the queſtion is whence comes that Milk, and what ſort of Spirit that is, which moves and animates the hand of an Image, to ſqueeſe the ſame milk out of its Paps. Boards, Marbles, and Pictures, you know, have neither Blood nor Milk of their own. Glorified Saints have none likewiſe: however S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> one of the four great Doctors of the Latin Church, and a very great Doctor indeed, knows none; and takes
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:132423:204"/>it as an impertinent Queſtion,
<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>August. ad Conſent. Epiſt.</hi> 146.</note> to ask, whether the Body of Chriſt in Heaven hath any Blood; much more, whether that of the Virgin hath any Milk. But whether it hath ſome, or hath none; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Bleſſed Virgin, for we ought know, hath kept her ſelf above in Heaven, during above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, without coming down to ſhow it. By a moſt juſt Judgment of God, the ſame Enchantment which is happened about the Graves, and generally about all unlawful Endeavors of ſeeking God out of his way, doth viſibly attend Images. When men applied themſelves, as I have ſaid once already, to Birds, in order to know things to come, ſome Spirits met them in that way, moving Ravens, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, and Eagles, to croak, to fly, and to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in that manner, by which men might gueſs and learn as much, as the ſpirits themſelves could teach. Aſſoon as they applied themſelves to conſulting, and watching Graves; theſe ſame ſpirits came up to them, under the ſhape and notion of the dead, who were called upon. And thus by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of all, as well learned Pagans, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Sepulchers, that, if not uſed this way, had nothing but their own Aſhes; came to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to have Gods. In the like manner when men began to gueſs, and to attend much to Images (harmleſs things, God knows, in their proper uſe, but very pernicious otherwiſe) theſe proved the moſt general Abode, and as it were the very Neſt of Helliſh Birds: and aſſoon as the Heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated them in their way, in order to find God therein, the Devils met with them in this way, making Images to move, to ſpeak, and often to be
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:132423:205"/>as quick at their Miracles, as the worſhippers were at their Praiers. So it is moſt generally true, that men cannot deviſe for themſelves any Religion ſo abſurd, to ſerve God with, but theſe Spirits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it: and will like beſt, what God hates moſt. I can ſhew all this out of the Fathers in their Diſputes againſt Pagans: and a great deal of it, out of the Pagans themſelves. To bring this home; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints were invoked, and their Images a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored at all; the Bleſſed Virgin ſtaid where ſhe is, in the Glory and Happineſs that ſhe is poſſeſt of, and before the Face and Throne of God. But as ſoon as her Image came in, (and Image worſhip came ſoon after) firſt ſhe, or rather ſome other Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her form, appears as a Private Perſon ſometimes in viſions, ſometimes in Dreams. As ſoon as the gray and black Friers came to be ſtrong in the Latin Church, and yet ſtronger in her Service; this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirit appears juſt as ſhe was praied and ſought after, as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Queen</hi> of Heaven, and the <hi>Governeſs</hi> of the whole world, with Crowns, and Saints, and Angels to attend her; and the better to encourage her devoted <hi>Monks</hi> to her ſervice, ſhe came with Books, or Gowns, or Hoods, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe proper to their Order; and this moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at their ſolemn Devotions in their Chappels. After, ſhe made bold to come in nearer, by day ſometimes into their Refectory, and by night into their Cells; there to ſprinkle them with holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to obſerve their modeſt lying in their Beds. Being come thus far, the next ſtep is to feel their Pulſe, if they be ſick: to rub the Backs of ſome, to cure their Diſeaſes; of others, to remove Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, the moſt general Diſeaſe of <hi>Monks.</hi> At
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:132423:205"/>laſt this Spirit came to embracing, to kiſſing, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and for the laſt favor (for I dare not go any farther) to ſhewing thoſe Mignions her Breaſt, and to refreſhing them with her Milk. Thus went ſhe in to <hi>S. Dominic,</hi> whom ſhe found once naked, ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in a Cavern. <hi>Here</hi>

And now let others decide the Caſe; whether the true and moſt pure Virgin forgets her ſelf, and all Modeſty, to become I do not know what to <hi>Monks,</hi> and to turn milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to Images? Or whether that kind of Spirits, which of courſe are uſed to provide Meat, Wine, and Dainties at their Meetings, be not fitter alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Milk: and with this and other Miracles, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude men, when by ſeeking God in painted walls, or carved Boards, in the judgment

                     <hi>Vincent. Bell. Specul. Hiſtor. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 87.</note> A young Gallant, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to play in a Place, where the ſame Virgin had a Statue; puts a Ring he had on its Finger, and after he had don playing, thinking to take his Ring again, the Image had cloſed her Finger; ſo being unwilling to ſtruggle too much, for tis not ſafe to be too bold with ſome Images, he left it there; and ſome few years after, he happened to get an honeſt Match, with a conſiderable Fortune: but he is not ſooner with her a Bed, then preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bride fairer then ſhe, appears to him, ſhews him his Ring, which he had left on the Statue, and, as ſhe took it, had engaged himſelf to her with it before. The man takes this for a Phantome, (and ſo it was, and a devilliſh one too) but when he thought again to ſleep, the ſame Lady comes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but much more terrible then before: and what with her angry look, what with her fearful Threatnings (for this Mother of Mercy will prove ſometimes a dangerous Dame) ſhe frighted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of his Bed, from his lawful Wife, &amp; his good Eſtate, into a pittiful Cloiſter. Now to judg how grave and holy this is, and how likely to come from a Saint; compare it with this Parallel, which I have
<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matthaeus Weſtmonaster. Flor. Hist. ad an.</hi> 1058.</note> from a good Author. In the year 1058. a young Nobleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> after a magnificent wedding Dinner, goes with his Gueſts to <hi>Campus Martius;</hi> and being at a hot Exerciſe puts his Ring into the finger of a ſtately brazen Image which ſtood hard by, and had in former times bin conſecrated to <hi>Venus:</hi> an hour after my Gentleman being to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:132423:207"/>return home, goes for his Ring; but the Statue had miraculouſly ſhut its hand: ſo being loth to ſpeak of it, for fear of being laughed at by his Friends, he leaves it there; and when it was night, coming back again with tools and men to get it off, the hand was open, but the Ring gon. So, the beſt he could make of a clear loſs, was to concele it, and to go to Bed with his Bride. As ſoon as they were in Bed he felt a big ſoft Bundle, as it had bin a ſack of Wool, tumbling between them, and hindering them from ever coming near one another: he heard withal a voice, <hi>Lie thou with me. I am</hi> Venus, <hi>whom thou hast taken to Wife this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with this Ring, which here is on my finger.</hi> To make ſhort, the ſame both Bundle and Voice kept them ever aſunder, as often as they offered to touch one another, till with the advice of their Friends, they went to one named <hi>Palumbus</hi> a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Necromancer</hi> and Prieſt, who for a good ſum of Mony meeting the Devil in his own way, got the Ring out of <hi>Venus</hi> hand. Theſe two Caſes are ſo like, that one might think them to have bin tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the one from the other; the ſame manner of wedding Apparitions: the ſame Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and Proxiſhip between theſe Spirits, and their Images: the ſame Malice and oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith and Gods Ordinance: the ſame baſe and low trifling, beneath the condition of any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature. Hereupon in Caſes ſo like, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, ſo ungodly, ſo unſeemly, let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> breed ſuch fools, as to think, that the one can be a great Saint, when the other is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place comes the Baby, whom
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:132423:207"/>moſt commonly you ſhall ſee doing ſome fooliſh thing or other upon the left Arm of this Dame. For this little Image is known to act as many Parts, as the great one can. It weeps, it prates, it ſings, it turns its back, it jumps from one hand to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſtretches out its little hand. And whereas at firſt it was intended, that this little thing ſhould ſtand ſtill, as an Hiſtorical Memorial of Chriſts Birth; it hath bin, ſince theſe laſt Ages, ſo well animated and warmed with the heat of <hi>Roman</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that it ſhews all the life and Activity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that can be expected of a true natural Child, beſides what Juglers can do. The inward Soul and Principle, which actuates and moves this Image certainly cannot be a good Angel: for good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are too ſerious for ſuch mere Childiſh Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Good Angels in all the Scriptures, ſince their Creation till Popery, are not known to ſpeak in Images: and when they ſpeak in any way, they do neither lie, nor blaſpheme; as this wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pupet muſt needs, whenſoever he takes on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the name of God, Chriſt, and Savior. The true Mover, and as it were the Soul of this Infantine Image, can be no other, then that Spirit, which often in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church appears acting that by himſelf, which he acts by his Image: and none is fitter nor likelier to prate with a woodden Parrot, then he that can do it with his own Lips. For ſetting a ſide the little Image; the Papiſts have a little God, whom they call in Engliſh the <hi>Sweet Babe,</hi> and more blaſphemouſly in Latin <hi>Puer Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Child Jeſus;</hi> and whom another Spirit under the name of <hi>Queen of Heaven</hi> in all great Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

However this is the Spirit (and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid we ſhould think him worth a better Name) that helps the Roman Crucifixes, and the ſweet wooden Babes to ſtir, to ſpeak, to work Miracles, at laſt to become the God of a ſpecial Confraternity called now adaies the <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Confraternity</hi> of <hi>the little Jeſus.</hi>

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:132423:209"/>S. <hi>Francis,</hi> after he had read the Goſpel, preacht with many tears and ſobs a moſt pathetical Sermon upon the Duty of that Night: and at that time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called Chriſt otherwiſe, then this ſweet Babe of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> My good Author informs me not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had provided for, and ſo pointed at a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Babe in the Manger.

                     <hi>Chronic. Deip. an.</hi> 1508. <hi>Michel Pius Chronic. an.</hi> 1510.</note> others likewiſe have found him ſince. He is the ſame Lad, who cried when he was half buried in the Snow: who uſed to skip and play about Churches: the very ſame, that doth appear ſtanding, or lying ſometimes upon Maſs wafers: and who by the Maſs Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is partly ſuſpected, partly judged to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. But let them judg, or ſuſpect what they pleaſe; It is as far from Jeſus Chriſt our Glorious Savior in Heaven, to come down now to play the Child, as to be ſo: and not ſo much as a wiſe grave and moral man (much leſs a Saint, much leſs an Angel, much leſs our Immortal Savior) would condeſcend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a fools Coat. But however, this Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has bin attended with ſuch Miracles, as have bin
<note n="i" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> able to make it paſs into a Piece of Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for holy Truth: And the ſame Hey (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſweet Baby ſlept) that had the vertue, as
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:132423:209"/>they ſay, to cure ſick Cattle, and to preſerve Men from all Diſeaſes, had the vertue to bring them too into a new Confraternity, which conſiſts much in waſhing, ſtarching, and ſowing Laces, wherewith at Chriſt-maſs to deck the Babe: a proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this very day for good Ladies. And we that have lived among them from the Perſecution of both the long Parliament, and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enough in twenty Years to ſee, and wonder at their folly, who think to make their Peace with God for the whole Year, by dreſſing and undreſſing, rocking, and worſhipping this Child that Night.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now laſtly, take both Mother and Child to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you ſhall find between them two, as much Witchcraft and Superſtition again. Theſe Images were not long adored in the Churches, but there went Stories abroad (true or untrue I decide not) that they did ſtir and work Miracles. The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and Adoration, of courſe invited the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to come in; and, by a recompence fit for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the ſtirring Spirit brought more Worſhip. Theſe ſeeming vital Motions, (however extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to Images in their harmleſs uſe, when they were but Memorials either of things paſt, or of Friends abſent) have ever bin moſt proper and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Idols; and you can hardly find any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pagans that is famous, but I can ſhew you, that upon fit occaſions it did ſpeak or move, or ſeemingly do greater Wonders. All this, and in this caſe, hath proved to be moſt advantageous to the advancing of <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip. For beſides the firſt account, which is harmleſs enough, when it goes no farther then repreſenting Chriſt made Man, and born of a Woman; this Image, as now it is uſed and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:132423:210"/>continually look'd on, fixes in the ſimple Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a ſottiſh notion of what he gazes upon continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to wit, here of Chriſts being ſtill a little Child, and there the Virgin being a great Queen. Hereupon their Speeches and Miracles improving this imagination, and Chriſt appearing in very deed prating and acting, as a dutiful Child under his Mother; or as an Infant with the Queen Regent: and at the ſame time great and glorious Apparitions of ſeeming Angels and Saints from Heaven, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting ſeemingly in their own Perſons, what theſe Images ſpeak and act in Churches; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath bin pleaſed to make her own public Praiers ſuitable to theſe three Patterns, <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, Actings,</hi> and <hi>Images.

S. <hi>Mary Razia,</hi> S. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> and S. <hi>Brigit,</hi> &amp;c. are known Inſtances of what I ſay. The ſweet Baby ſometimes makes ſweet returns in the ſame kind. For when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gets Husbands, the Child acts the part of a Prieſt: and, as it appears in S. <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Ceſtercian,</hi> whom
<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chronic. Deip. an.</hi> 1292.</note> ſhe would be eſpouſed to, he marries and bleſſes them together. All theſe Paſſages are to be ſeen, both in the viſible Motion, and in the audible Language of Images: and theſe Images are anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both to move, and to ſpeak as they do, by thoſe Spirits who call themſelves the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and her <hi>ſweet Babe.</hi> Now that theſe are but evil Spirits, what title ſoever they may take (unleſs poſſibly Impoſture, and the knavery of Prieſts may claim a ſhare) the very ridiculouſneſs and unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their doings, are their Heralds to proclaim it: and as to their being Queen of Heaven, or a Savior, or any good Angel, none beſides the Papiſts, but a <hi>Lucian,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> or ſome like Blaſphemer of Chriſts Name, will have People believe they are, to ſhame with this Belief, Chriſts Holy Name and Religion. After that, how far theſe Spirits will proceed beyond their giving and being given in Marriage, I cannot tell, as to the act: but as to the poſſibility of worſe, it is certain, that Spirits, who offer to be both unholy and untrue, may be unclean too. Learned Men know, what other Demons, <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and other Pagan
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:132423:211"/>Gods and Goddeſſes have proved to be in the very heat of their moſt ſeemingly Sacred and Religious Myſteries. For my part, I have lived too long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, to take Convents and Monaſteries, which theſe Apparitions uſe moſt to haunt, for Schools of any Chaſtity. Beſides what I know by Books, I know particularly by above twenty little Skulls, digged out of the Ditches of a ruinated Nunnery (called <hi>Font-ſome,</hi> near St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> where we camped a while in the Year 1658.) ſad Evidences, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides moſt cruel, moſt impure Spirits had bin there: and it is upon a long continued Experience, that the Sins of the Fleſh, and the Worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, go both under one name in the Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. <hi>Thus they defiled themſelves with their own works, and went a whoring after their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> To lay aſide the unclean part of this Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, there is another as Deviliſh that attends it, the Worſhipping of Devils or Ghoſts of dead Men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Saints; which moſt real and pitiful, tho moſt unperceived Sorcery, hath ever bin the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fate of Image-worſhipping, and corrupted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and hardly ever Men left God, and turned aſide from his waies, without meeting with ill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Thus did the two Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> when in their Poſterity they turned the Religion of their Father into an Heatheniſh Image Service: thus did alſo the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as ſoon as they fell to their Idols: and thus after them have the <hi>Jews</hi> done, by falling to their Conjurings. And, how were it now poſſible for Men to eſcape it, who fall to both; to wit, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Service,</hi> and ſtrange <hi>Exorciſms?</hi> I do not love to aggravate Burthens, which of themſelves are too heavy. But without aggravation, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:132423:211"/>that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſerves more Images then all the Heathens did together: ſhe hath evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Conjurings, both public and privat ones, then all the <hi>Jews.</hi> And ſo accordingly I may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the beſt Scholar, and beſt vers'd in Antiquity, to ſhew me ſuch droves of Spirits running after Men and Women, among either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> as I can ſhew him, falſe Saints haunting and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſometimes Monks, ſometimes Nuns, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times other Superſtitious Perſons among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. This being ſo, no Man muſt wonder, if he ſees <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince ſhe is turned <hi>Roman Catholic,</hi> both more defiled with all Uncleanneſſes, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to Bloody Maſſacres, and owning both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently, then ever ſhe was when mere <hi>Pagan.</hi> And without theſe two ſad Effects, that could never have bin influenced upon Chriſtianity, but from Hell; the Great and Glorious God and Savior Chriſt, is, as much as in <hi>Rome</hi> lies, degraded out of Heaven, by the ſame Devils, into a Boy that ſleeps on ſtraw, or cries and tumbles in deep Snow, or runs and plaies with other Lads, or is every day kept in a Wafer, which a Maſs-Prieſt hath enchanted.

            <p>In the whole courſe of this his Vindication, the good Man favors me ſo far, as not to anſwer one wiſe Word, to any thing that ſeems to be ſomewhat material in my Book; only leaving his dear Jewel under all the dirt imaginable, he ſhews by what he is pleaſed to write, how he is well reſolved to make much of it, ſuch as it is; and like a tender-hearted Parent, to kiſs the Child, tho it be deformed.</p>
            <p>This fondneſs of Affection renders all his Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings more excuſable. Men, we know, will defend what they love thus, what way they can: and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches the very Children, when you take from them what they fancy, to ſcratch and cry. Only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all his ill Language, I muſt find fault with his Prudence, when he calls me an <hi>Ignorant.</hi> For if an <hi>Ignorant</hi> can produce and prove ſuch fowl Crimes againſt his Maſs, as I do in that Book which he rails at: What could not a Learned Man do? And what muſt he think of himſelf, ſince all along his Book and mine, he cannot anſwer an Idiot?</p>
            <p>Inſtead of anſwering the Charge, which being heavy and true, as it is, confounds his Maſs even to Hell; all he can do, is to exalt it with vain cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors above the Sky: and when this unhappy <hi>Diana</hi>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:132423:214"/>ſtands accuſed of being nothing but Wood and Stone, to ſpend himſelf in crying out, <hi>She is a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,</hi> Act. 19.28.</p>
            <p>Yet in this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> which is the main ſcope of his Book, he falls ſhort of what he aims at. Among all the Fathers, which he heaps up after <hi>Coccius,</hi> one on another; not one ſaies, that Prieſts hold or give the true and natural Fleſh of Chriſt, otherwiſe then in Sacrament; nor that they offer it up to God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then in a commemorative Sacrifice, which is the drift of the <hi>Roman Maſs,</hi> and the Point which he ſhould make out. But he muſters out as many places as he can find, that make any mention of <hi>Liturgy, Oblation, Holy Victime, Incruental Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Maſs</hi> ſomtimes, which no Proteſtants diſpute againſt: and whenſoever he can lay hold of any ſuch Expreſſions (which he ſees in my Book I am not unwilling to admit) he thinks he hath done great matters. Eſpecially as ſoon as he can light upon the Prieſt-hood of Jeſus Chriſt, or the Bleſſed Communion, if alluded to, or compared with <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi>'s Bread and Wine, his mind runs out to Fleſh and Blood. And in this vain labor doth the poor Man ſpend his four firſt and longeſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters.</p>
            <p>His fifth, About the neceſſity of Sacrifices, ſtands for what no Man ſtands againſt; to wit, that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations &amp; Sacrifices muſt needs be had in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church. The Queſtion is, Whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Roman Maſs</hi> be one of them. I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt neceſſary Evidences, that it is a plain Sacrilege, Abomination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>R. F.</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it.</p>
            <pb n="409" facs="tcp:132423:214"/>
            <p>His ſixth Chapter comes ſomewhat cloſer to me, and what he calls my two Inventions, to exclude the Maſs Sacrifice, One is taken out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and urg'd againſt all evaſion in the 4th Chapter of my Book, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is well pleaſed in a manner to paſs by: Bones too hard for weak teeth, and, which tho but thrown down in the way, might make Maſs-Prieſts tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they had not the wit to leap over them. The ſecond is about my quoting of S. <hi>Austin de Civit. Dei lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Durand</hi> concerning that which he calls the lawful Maſs <hi>Miſſa Legitima,</hi> and the Sacrifice continuing in the Interceſſion of Chriſt. Whereon I will ſay nothing to him, but that he ſhould have read what he carps at, with ſome kind of attention, rather then expoſe himſelf to the hazard of cenſuring me, like one who had neither common ſenſe nor Conſcience.</p>
            <p>His 7th Chapter contains for the moſt part a long and extraordinary Amazement, why I ſhould quote <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the Schole-men, ſince they are all againſt me, and for Maſs; and herein the Gentleman ſeems to be ſo ſtrangely perplexed about my fooliſh Impertinencies, that it is charity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him, and to help him to underſtand that I make uſe of his Authors, either to ſhew the world what fine Myſteries, whereof <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> could not be the proper Witneſſes, are contained in his holy Maſs: or to convince him how this <hi>Babel</hi> confounds ſometimes her own Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: or to ſome other good purpoſe that no wiſe man ſhould wonder at. But when he is pleaſed to think that I quote them fraudulently, or that I
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:132423:215"/>have not read them at all; till he can produce ſome clear Inſtance of this my fraudulent dealing, I will leave him to his own thoughts.</p>
            <p>His 8th Chapter is againſt two groſs Miſtakes, which, as he thinks, I poor ignorant am fallen into. 1. When I ſaid ſomewhere they do Sacrifice Chriſt at Maſs, whereas they ſacrifice his Fleſh only. 2. When I ſeem to be afraid, leſt the Body of Chriſt ſhould ſuffer harm, whenſoever they throw it down to the ground, or into ſinks and privy Houſes. For the firſt, I have ſome hope that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whom I have there quoted to that purpoſe, will in a great meſure protect me: and tho they do not, how comes this learned man to be ignorant of their commonly receiv'd Doctrine, that the Body and Blood are not upon the Altar without the Soul? and if the two former are there by the direct ſtrength of the five conſecrating words, this follows them perpetually by a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance. But as to my ſecond miſtake, let him read the 7th Chapter, of my <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> and anſwer it. Mean while I adviſe him, not to make that honeſt Care, which the Church doth preſcribe ſometimes of keeping conſecrated things ſafe and decent, a proof of tranſubſtantiation, leſt his very Altars, Images, Croſſes, Patens, Chalices, Oiles, and other hallowed Utenſils, which he would not thro negligence let fall to the ground, have a worſe luck, and by his Tranſubſtantiation, among his wafers looſe their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>His 9th Chapter is ſpent to prove that his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles about Maſs grow not leſſe for being many, which no body, for ought I know, contends they do;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:132423:215"/>for they being nothing at all, it matters not how little or big they are accounted to be. And here the Gentleman having it ſeems little to do, falls foul on my Folly, for attributing theſe Miracles to the Prieſts power, and not to God; which I do no more then themſelves: and for bringing their Imaginary Chriſt from Heaven; which is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh of their Adductive Motion. At laſt he brings all to this Iſſue; that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>John Calvin</hi> make very much for theſe tranſubſtantiating Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>His 10th Chapter runs all along upon a more popular Error, as if Chriſts true real Preſence at the adminiſtration of his holy Myſteries, were that very Preſence, which involves within its being all the aforeſaid fooliſh Miracles; and which, when all is done, proves nothing better, as it were eaſie to demonſtrate, then a true real Abſence. Then he inſiſts on Gods Power, to prove the being of his Miracles: and would fain have us to believe them upon their being not impoſſible: (on which ground a man would believe ſtrange things) however it is better to disbelieve them, upon their being imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, injurious to Chriſt as man, and in point of Faith, deſtitute of any the leaſt ground in his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>In his 11 and 12 Chapters, he makes it his whole buſineſs in behalf of the Abſurdities, which his Church takes for Myſteries, to diſcredit Senſe and Reaſon: and rails bitterly againſt me as a ſcoffing, jeering Buffoon for uſing them, not as my chief Grounds and Treachers in Chriſtian Religion (for ſo far the Gentleman were right) but as good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient helps to defend it from his Follies; the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:132423:216"/>truth is, he is the fitteſt man to believe Maſs and Popery, who beſt can diſown all Reaſon. Wherein our Author is fairly advanc'd, who in favor of this brutiſh Theme, is not afraid to cite St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> one of the moſt rational of all the Fathers, and the moſt full of Arguments out of Nature, Senſe, and Reaſon, even in thoſe very Books and Places where he cites him.</p>
            <p>His 13th Chapter is a Rhapſody of ſeveral Fathers and Doctors, which have bin anſwered forty times: beſides an Imaginary Contradiction which he is pleaſed to put upon me, when I ſay, as I do, that Popiſh Maſs may take its Date with Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion from their famous <hi>Lateran</hi> Council: and when he fanſies that I ſay, which I do not, nor ever did, that this ſame Popiſh Maſs hath laſted 1200. years.</p>
            <p>His 14th Chapter is a long and looſe diſcourſe, both againſt our Ordination, and in behalf of his Prieſthood, where he is ſo extremly diſcreet, as not to name me ſo much as once; much leſs to anſwer that heavy Charge of Uſurpation, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, which upon this every account I have juſtly laid on his Church.</p>
            <p>His 15th and laſt Chapter concludes that Maſs Adoration is in no wiſe Idolatry, by a formal Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm, that is a reaſoning againſt all Rules <hi>ex mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore negante in prima Figura:</hi> by the Teſtimony of Dr <hi>Thorndike:</hi> by ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation, and confounding it with the Real Preſence; by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Averroes</hi> a learned <hi>Turk:</hi> and by ſeveral miſunderſtood ſayings and Practiſes of holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their worſhip at the bleſſed Communion; all proofs well becoming the caſe: but too weak
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:132423:216"/>for him to ſtand upon, and for me to take notice of. Eſpecially ſince he is pleaſed all along to leave my Reaſons againſt Maſs untoucht, and ſo the Maſs undefended.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Gentleman calls for a Judg and a Jury; which (if not corrupted and packt) muſt needs find this Client guilty; ſince he ſtands theſe two years charged with ſuch clear and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Accuſations, that hitherto no body ventures to meddle with them. Only the Gentleman promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes another learned Pen, which, as he hopes, ſhall do the Deed. Mean while he will end as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, railing at me, and wondering at my Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Ignorance, Inſolence, Folly, Malice, for medling at all with his Schole-men, Liturgies, Councils, and Fathers. I hope the other learned Pen will be civil. So if he come out with any thing for the Vindication of his Maſs, that may be called an Anſwer, (the Lord giving me ſome health with life) he ſhall not tarry long for a Reply.</p>
